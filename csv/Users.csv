After that I discovered the list of op-codes next to the ASCII chart in my ZX-81 manual.  I began to compile my own hand-lettered sheets that put all the addressing modes of a given instruction in the same place so I could more easily handle-assemble small machine language programs.</p>

I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
still alive.


I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think i prefer to stay inside.
maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
Anyway this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist
look at me still talking when theres science to do
when i look out there
it makes me glad I'm not you
i've experiments to run
there is research to be done
on the people who are
still alive.


and believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
i feel fantastic and I'm still alive
while your dying ill be still alive
and when your dead i will be still alive
still alive
still alive",0,0,0,2976,http://notandy.googlepages.com/,

<p>My main strength is developing web applications in high-level languages – Python is my favorite – but I consider myself more of a general hacker who is comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and learning whatever I need to accomplish the task at hand. (I suppose that <em>full-stack</em> is the trendy term.) In my study of infosec, I have spent a lot of time learning to read assembly and reverse engineer applications to develop exploits. (I have the OSCP, CISSP, and CEH certifications.)</p>

<p>I have released a couple of work projects as open source. I created an easy-to-use web crawler called <a href=""https://gitlab.com/hyperion-gray/starbelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starbelly</a>, as well as a database migrations system called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agnostic</a>. And if you want to get really nerdy with me, I wrote a tiny utility called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sshadduser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sshadduser</code></a> that simplifies the error-prone process of giving somebody SSH access to a server. I also like writing and teaching. In addition to developing infosec courses for government clients, I also participate here on Stack Overflow and infrequently publish on <a href=""https://markhaa.se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my tech blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have been working full-time remote for several years now out of my home office in the Washington DC area. I am seeking contract work (1099) for 2018.</p>

<h1>Comparison of Python 3 and Perl 6 (both very nice languages)</h1>

<h2>Python 3: find common lines between two files, regardless of the order:</h2>

<pre><code>#!/bin/env python

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Determine the lines in common between two files')

parser.add_argument('fileA', help='file name')
parser.add_argument('fileB', help='file name')

args = parser.parse_args()

with open(args.fileA) as x: linesA = x.readlines()
with open(args.fileB) as x: linesB = x.readlines()

intersection = set(linesA).intersection(set(linesB))

print("""".join(sorted(intersection)))
</code></pre>

<p>Usage message resulting from <code>python intersection_of_lines.py --help</code>:</p>

<pre><code>usage: intersection_of_lines.py [-h] fileA fileB

Determine the lines in common between two files

positional arguments:
  fileA       file name
  fileB       file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>

<h2>Perl 6: find common lines between two files, regardless of the order:</h2>

<pre><code>#!/bin/env perl6

sub MAIN #= Determine the lines in common between two files
(   $fileA, #= file name
    $fileB, #= file name
)
{
    my @linesA = $fileA.IO.lines;
    my @linesB = $fileB.IO.lines;

    my $intersection = @linesA ∩ @linesB;

    put $intersection.keys.sort.join(""\n"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yes that is <code>∩</code>, a real intersection symbol, thanks to Unicode support. You can also use <code>(&amp;)</code> for intersection, if your editor has issues with Unicode. </p>

<p>You also get a nice usage message resulting from <code>perl6 intersection_of_lines.p6 --help</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
  ./intersection_of_lines.p6 &lt;fileA&gt; &lt;fileB&gt; -- Determine the lines in common between two files

    &lt;fileA&gt;    file name
    &lt;fileB&gt;    file name
</code></pre>

<h1>Perl 6 tidbits</h1>

<p>Perl 6 is a very clean, concise, understandable language. It is a new language (not just a different version of Perl). Its design pulls from the strengths of other languages. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Copy/paste security doesn't exist</strong>.</p>

<p>All of the high scoring answers on StackOverflow have displayed grave security mistakes.</p>

<p>If the code runs it does not mean it is secure. I would guess that about 10% of the code posted on StackOverflow <em>could be</em> secure. If you want to learn cryptography I highly recommend Crypto I from Dan Boneh at Coursera as a (University level) introductory course.</p>

<p>The most basic and therefore most common security mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>not understanding the difference between encoding and encryption;</li>
<li>using keys or IV's directly derived from text / passwords;</li>
<li>using ECB mode encryption;</li>
<li>using MD5, DES or other outdated cryptographic algorithms;</li>
<li>not understanding on how to use an IV / nonce;</li>
<li>performing password hashing (or key derivation) without applying PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt</li>
<li>using ciphertext that is not protected by an authentication tag;</li>
<li>thinking that OTP (XOR-encryption) can be made secure (without inventing an inefficient stream cipher);</li>
<li>encryption without establishing trust (most browser based encryption);</li>
<li>using textbook RSA or using RSA to directly encrypt messages;</li>
<li>inventing transport based security instead of using (D)TLS;</li>
<li>not using a cryptographically secure random number generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're making any of the above mistakes <em>please hire a professional</em>. Please do not rely solely on StackExchange answers.</p>

M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<p>An oligarchy of five justices setting policy for the entire USA is not the government the Constitution guarantees, and it's not the one we want.  Not everything President Gerald Ford said was very smart or worth repeating, but this is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA was designed as a Constitutional Republic, with checks-and-balances between the branches of the federal government, and also division of power between federal state and local governments.  (And these are explicitly required by the plain language of the Constitution)  All government officials need to stay within the authority granted to them by the Constitution, especially when that means they can't do whatever they want.</p>

<p>
A user interface is well-designed when the program behaves exactly how the user thought it would.
</p>

<p>There is no right answer ... and always a better way. Show and discuss your code, without emotional attachment. You are not your code.</p>

<p>Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.</p>

<p>We’re building something here ... and all the pieces matter.</p>

<p>The game isn't really about big edges and firework displays; it's about subtle advantages and what happens in the long run.</p>

<p>It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets credit.</p>

<p>Maybe the best programmers aren’t those who spectacularly solve crazy problems, but those who don’t create them, which is much more silent.</p>

<p>I enjoy using my experience to help others. That is why I am active at a number of <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/10806/torben-gundtofte-bruun?tab=accounts"">other sites</a> in the StackExchange network on topics that interest me. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd""><img src=""http://se-flair.appspot.com/png/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd"" alt=""valuable flair!""></a> </p>

<p>I'm something of a Swiss army knife both professionally and in private, able to juggle a wild variety of things at once. I've worked in every kind of business that uses software. I'm also very good with tools, both IT and mechanic. Whether you need software design or assembling some IKEA furniture, I'm your man for the job. I'm generally soft-spoken but driven by clear principles.</p>

<p>I'm a twin, I've lived in five countries, I speak four languages fluently and two more embarrassingly. Also, being a father routinely develops my patience which is useful for moderating on StackExchange too. </p>

It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast.

Tell me if the Luynes, the Ballegardes, and the Bassompierres have merited, as we have, fortunes and honors? You are right, my friend, a hundred times right."" - Comte de la Fère</p>

<p>Was surprised that relational databases aren't a dry subject after all. Learned SQL. Started to enthusiastically use databases for everything, even in lieu of in-memory data structures. Came a bit off databases again: while it is possible to, say, write Tetris in SQL, it's not exactly advisable.</p>

Python was my first love, a multiplatform programming language that's easy to read and has excellent documentation. I would study it and build tool and toy applications, which lead me to first professional programming experience at thirteen, and I have been a software contractor ever since. During high-school, I learned PHP to work on an Open Source project, a 3D Racing Game Server. This project brought me to Git and Github for version control and collaborating on other open source projects.</p>

<p>I wrote web scrapers, spiders, and other data mining tools for a price tracking service for two years. These were only twenty/thirty-hour weeks but the work of building product scraping tools is so tedious I started to focus on writing code that would help me generate them.</p>

<p>I have worked side by side university professors and a media team to push out course materials for Python Programming and Data Analysis on a tight deadline. Coursera published the courses as Specialization tracks.</p>

<p>I love collaborating with start-ups, individuals, and consultancies.
I am always open to learning and new challenges which can make me grow as a collaborator and software developer, especially when exposed to new technologies or solving unique problems for people and businesses. I have gravitated towards technology as a tool to can the biggest impact.</p>

<p>My web development weapons of choice are Flask or Django if I am working in Python, Laravel or Phalcon if I am starting new projects in PHP and I use Express when working /w JavaScript/NodeJS.</p>

<p>I've been doing majority backend work but I've been studying and focusing on front-end with React and React-Native lately.</p>

<p>I also have quite a bit of experience /w Linux and have built myself a home networking lab to practice Penetration Testing and other security topics as a hobby, so I am very interested in moving into Security or Linux Administration.</p>

<p>I've been writing code since I was 12 years old (professionally since 22 or so), and some day – hopefully soon - I'll figure out how to do it properly.<br/></p>

<p>I'm married (sorry ladies), and she's gorgeous, she's so far out of my league we're playing different sports. I swear there are days I marvel that she doesn't snap out of it and decide she can do far better :) . . . but I’m very glad she doesn’t. <br/></p>

<p>My second love for many years would have been C++, which has been pushed out by C#, very powerful, very concise. <br/></p>

<p>I often work with Vb, but I dislike it, being much more enamoured of the curly brace than I am of hugely verbose syntax.<br/></p>

<p>Although it’s many years since we last parted, I still hold a grudge against Vb3, 4, 5 &amp; 6, oh, and all flavours of VBA. Languages that are, IMHO, as wrong and unholy as . . . well . . .  something that’s <em>really</em> wrong and unholy (pick your own desecration and go with that imagery, I’m not going to do all the work for you). . . there are whole years I spent bleeding and blistered on the Pre Vb.Net cross . . . and I’m glad I can say “never again”.<br/></p>

<p>I have worked on more than a few web applications mostly using node and I'm quite well versed in node.js and Javascript. I also know my way around in command line. Talking about command line, I prefer Unix(I'm an Ubuntu user, but I'd also love OS X). I don't use vim anymore, but the habit is still there and working in an IDE without proper vim key bindings feels like I'm digging my grave with my bare hands. :)</p>

<p>Interested in contributing in open source projects. I have made a few contributions here and there in the previous years: <a href=""https://github.com/alFReD-NSH"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/alFReD-NSH</a></p>

<p>Nowadays, professionally I'm mainly:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Linux server admin (mostly SUSE - openSUSE and SLES - and some Red Hat - RHEL) of Testing, Development and Production servers (both physical servers and virtual machines - usually VMware) </li>
<li>...and an admin of VMware vSphere ESXi/vCenter Server clusters. So, I work regularly with VMware products, namely vSphere (began on ESX 4.0, now on ESXi 6.0 and vCenter Server 6.0). </li>
</ul>

<p>My laptop and netbook also run Linux (namely Ubuntu).</p>

<p>The coding that I do is mostly in Perl and ""shell scripts"" (for the ""bash"" shell) for automating system administration tasks in Linux servers. In ""previous lives"", I coded web applications in PHP for LAMP based projects and also in ASP (""Active Server Pages""), both ""classic ASP"" - ASP + VBScript - and ASP.Net - using C#</p>

<p><strong>Some of my Certifications:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RHCE</strong> - ""<em>Red Hat Certified Engineer</em>"" (valid, but no longer current since December 2017)</li>
<li><strong>SCE</strong> - ""<em>SUSE Certified Engineer</em>"" in Enterprise Linux 12</li>
<li><strong>LFCE</strong> - ""<em>Linux Foundation Certified Engineer</em>""</li>

I like to make web pages, mostly with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, &amp; in the past PHP (I used the CodeIgniter framework). I like to tinker and I like to build. I rock climb and scuba dive and play indoor soccer.</p>

<p>I am an Information Security Architect at a large company in a non-IT industry. I have been working in the IT field for more than a decade.

I also have the privilege of conducting security reviews of the contracts that my company negotiates with vendors.</p>

<p>I am the founder and developer of a rock climbing website called Log the Crux. Its goal is to give rock climbers a place to log their rock climbing sessions, and get stats on those climbs and sessions, something akin to RunKeeper or MapMyFitness. I’ve done a lot of work on it, and have a couple of great friends who help me test on an almost daily basis. I still have a long way to go, and recently decided to rewrite the entire thing as a single page javascript application, away from the PHP framework I’ve been using for a couple of years. IT should be interesting going forward.</p>

Since February 2014, <strong>Ukraine has been suffering from Russia's armed invasion</strong> and partial occupation. Invading Ukraine, however, is not the final goal for Russian ""hybrid war"". <strong>The final goal is you.</strong> If we, the Ukrainians, fail to stop the Russian tanks on our soil, someone else would have to stop them in Poland, Finland, Baltic states, and finally, in your place.<br>
While there is no doubt that your country's army can stop the Russians, think if you want to see <strong>a burning Russian tank on the lawn in front of your home</strong>. Or think whether you want to become a ""collateral victim"" when KGB assassinates someone using military-grade nerve agent in the center of <strong>your city</strong>. Would you wait till that moment or act now (by calling your Senator, for example)?</p>

<p>The world has to stay together to stop Russian invasion in Europe as well as the Russian-equipped, Russian-trained, Russian-financed, and Russian-inspired terrorism all over the world.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Security requires a particular mindset. Security professionals -- at
  least the good ones -- see the world differently. They can't walk into
  a store without noticing how they might shoplift. They can't use a
  computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities. They
  can't vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice. They just
  can't help it.</p>

<p>My main development platform is Visual Studio with Team Foundation Server, and I am working with C#, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, LINQ, Entity Framework etc. I am also very interested in efficient algorithms of all kinds, cryptography, multithreading, tips &amp; tricks ...</p>

<p>In my opinion, StackOverflow is a great platform to exchange knowlege like this and I found many tips there, which is why I am always very motivated to give back knowlege by answering questions where I can.</p>

<p><sup>*) Note: According to wikipedia, the German diplom is comparable with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in one (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplom</a>).</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>Some <strong>hints and tips</strong> around Stack Exchange: <br/></p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search"">https://stackoverflow.com/search</a>, click on ""Advanced..."" to show options</li>
<li>Search within your favorites: Enter <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3683/search-in-favorited-questions/161053#161053""><code>infavorites:mine search_expression</code></a></li>
<li>Search within your posts related to a tag. For example: <code>user:mine [C#]</code> finds everything you have posted that is related to C#.</li>
<li>Run SQL queries against stack overflow posts: check <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-cc-data-now-hosted-by-the-internet-archive/"">this</a> out to download an archive and <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://data.stackexchange.com/</a> to run SQL queries against current stack exchange sites</li>
<li>Use keyboard tags, e.g. <code>&lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;</code> appears as <kbd>Alt</kbd></li>
<li>If necessary, add line breaks with <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> <sup>*)</sup></li>
<li>Syntax highlighting in your posts - Use a tag like: <br/><code>&lt;!-- language-all: lang-cs --&gt;</code><br/>For available tags, see: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/AWMtu5rK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a> and <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/72082/changes-to-syntax-highlighting"">that link</a> (meta)</li>
<li>Version tags: Use them to mark pre-C#6: <code>&lt;!-- if version [lt 6.0] --&gt;</code></li>
<li>To add runnable CSS/HTML/JavaScript code, use the code sample icon <code>{}</code> when editing your question rather than providing a <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JsFiddle</a> link (but JsFiddle is good for testing). <br/>If you want to add runnable .NET code (C#, F# or VB.NET), you can create it in <a href=""https://dotnetfiddle.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DotNetFiddle</a> and add a link (please provide the code in SO too because the link might become unusable). For screenshots you can use the free tool <a href=""http://www.screentogif.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.screentogif.com/</a><br/></li>
<li><strong>Hide answers:</strong> use <code>&gt;!</code>, like so (point with the mouse):
<br/> <em>What is the answer to the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ultimate question</a>?</em></strong> 

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The answer is <strong>42</strong>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><sup>*) use <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> for superscript/subscript</sup></p>

<p>These days it's Microsft products paying the bills, for what difference it makes.  Whether it's a multi-domain AD environment with tens of thousands of users, a small cluster of Linux webservers, or a tangled web of network cables, systems are all just complex tools to do complex jobs, perpetually in need of someone to make them perform better and ensure they're always available when someone needs them.</p>

<p>Since being a lawyer seemed to boring, being a doctor seemed to hard, and my idea of a good time usually involves using a powerful computer anyway, I really can't imagine doing anything else.</p>

First computer I owned was a Sinclair ZX-81 on which I progressed to programming Z80 assembler by the time I was 13. I consider programming to be a lifetime learning experience.</p> 

<p>Most of my professional experience has been programming in C and Java primarily in the networking and communications arena.  More recently JavaScript for web and mobile applications enters into the mix. In the early professional years there was Pascal and COBOL and in the 90's a fair amount of iSeries CLP and some RPG. On the markup side of things I have had to learn a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and various dialects of XML, including SOAP (XML) web services.</p>

<p>My programming hobby activities are mostly in Java, but I enjoy dabbling with a variety of procedural, OOP and functional languages and the many hybrids thereof.</p>

<p>Of a personal nature, I am a committed Christian; I guess one would best describe me as ""Evangelical"", though it's tough to find a moniker that works well. I enjoy philosophical and scientific discussions and I am firmly convinced that real, practical Christianity engages the whole person, heart, mind and spirit. Christianity is a faith that involves reason and intellect, an aspect which has been neglected in the 20th century church: ""Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the <strong>renewal of your mind</strong>, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to this random assortment of facts.</p>

<p>I have been developing software for a long time. I also manage software projects. I enjoy both the tactical aspect of writing code as well as the strategic aspect of keeping the customer happy, the development team happy and building software that will Do Something Useful.</p>

<h2>Industries I've Worked</h2>

<p>IT is everywhere! Most industries are very similar when it comes to employee needs, although one might think they're very different. I've seen Financial Traders get just as worked up and panicked as Healthcare Staff when their systems aren't working properly. My job is to make it so whatever the user wants to do is <em>EASY</em> and, in effect, so that they don't even notice me.*</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Process Improvement,</li>
<li>Chemical,</li>
<li>Education,</li>
<li>Energy (oil, gas, &amp; electricity),</li>
<li>Entertainment,</li>
<li>Financial,</li>
<li>Healthcare,</li>
<li>Marketing,</li>
<li>Media,</li>
<li>Property Management, and</li>
<li>Software (the company's actual product)

<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile (Android + IOS) App Development</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite OS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mac OSX is my primary (the command line rocks for unleashing the power of bash)</li>
<li>Debian for regular server</li>
<li><strike>Windows</strike> <strike>XBox</strike> PS4 for the games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preferred Browsers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chrome, hands down</li>
<li>Firefox, if you're nasty</li>
<li>Safari, if I must</li>
<li>IE if you want me to hate my job</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Languages</h2>

<p>There isn't really a favorite, just languages that are better suited for a particular task/application. I want to <strong>use the best tool for the job</strong>, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument"" rel=""nofollow"">not everything is a nail</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby/Rails</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Objective C</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>NodeJS (Angular, Ember, etc)</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>

<p><em>BEFORE:</em> I started playing around with computers in 1984, and started my professional career in 2000. Since then, I used to be a C++ developer, sysadmin, ""webdesigner"", coded in Bash, PHP, Perl, Python, Java, JavaScript and Golang and always felt well working close to the OS. I love to automate things and be lazy, watching automations do all the work for me. </p>

<p>Since 2010 I focused on infrastructure and systems engineering. My current main fields of interest are containers, schedulers, distributed services / systems and working in a great team on awesome products. </p>

<p>Subayai (""agile"" in Japanese), is a highly specialized IT consulting firm with a focus on logistics, e-commerce, payment and security. His customers tend to be banks and large corporations that need systems that work well for many years. We believe in <em>iterative development</em> though not necessarily all that is <a href=""http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Cargo-Cult-Agile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Agile/Scrum</a>.</p>

<p>Darrell travels a lot, commuting between the US and EU for his customers and because he is a great fan of jet noise.</p>

<p>Darrell does not profess to know everything.</p>

<p>Indeed, he has reached such a point of enlightenment that he now truly understands the depths of his own ignorance. However, despite these short-comings, Darrell likes to help others for fun and profit where possible and thus has a small presence on some of Joel's sites.</p>

<p><strong>Laziness</strong>: I'm too lazy to do the same task repeatedly so write scripts to do that task for me. This makes people think I am intelligent.</p>

<p><strong>Impatience</strong>: I'm too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.</p>

<p><strong>Hubris</strong>: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anything.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it means I can make a career out of being Lazy, Impatient, and Hubristic(?).</p>

He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>

<p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short. 
Disappointed, Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>

<p>I try to write clean code, which is easy to test, maintainable, expandable and easy to change without great efforts. </p>

<p>I'm also interested in testable code design (e.g by dependency injection) and software tests in general.</p>

<p>I like code, which is easy to read and easy to understand, because programming is most of the time teamwork. I like re-factoring and design patterns as well.</p>

I specialize in creating robust data integration solutions using SSIS and bespoke .NET applications. These integrations extract data from custom data sources like cloud services or support ETL to populate data warehouses designed using both dimensional and ensemble modelling techniques. I am a proficient SQL server database developer and have my SQL Server MCSA.</p>

<p>I often build bespoke .NET applications using C# to support our data integrations. As well as the occasional ASP.NET website for data collection and presentation. I also build SSRS reports mostly to do with monitoring the health of the integration solutions but I have also done plenty of more complex reporting. Lately a lot of focus has been on building business intelligence solutions in AWS and Azure.</p>

<p>E.A. Wallis Budge, <em>The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Positive philosophy stands in a very ambiguous relation to Kant's views.
  It accepts them and does not accept them: 
  it accepts and considers them correct in their relation to the direct
  experience of the organs of sense -- what we see, hear, touch.
  That is, positive philosophy recognizes the subjectivity of our receptivity,
  and recognizes everything that we perceive in objects as imposed upon them by ourselves --
  but this in relation to the direct experiences of the senses only.</p>
  
  <p>When it concerns itself with ""scientific experience"" however,
  in which precise instruments and calculations are used,
  positive philosophy evidently considers Kant's view in relation to that invalid,
  assuming tht ""scientific experience"" makes known to us the very substance of things,
  the true causes of our sensations -- or if it does not do so now,
  it brings us closer to the truth of things, and can inform us later.</p>
  
  <p>... Of course it is possible not to know Kant, but it is impossible to controvert him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pyotr Dem'anovich Ouspensky, <em>Tertium Organum</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
  language, because every natural science always involves three things:
  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
  the same reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of
  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of
  truth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the
  understanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;
  that is, to contradict itself.</p>

I have also started using <a href=""https://www.livecoding.tv/sehe/"" rel=""nofollow"">LiveCoding.tv</a> so I can share the process of answering. This  often involves</p>

<ul>
<li>writing a Proof-Of-Concept</li>
<li>doing actual benchmarking (right)</li>
<li>reproducing a specific problem (and root-causing/fixing/finding a workaround)</li>
</ul>

<p>I got the impression more than once that people think that ""we, the experts"" use some kind of <strong><em>magic fairy dust</em></strong> and promptly post the solutions without breaking a sweat, I thought it would be nice to show the reality.</p>

<p><strong>Project Euler Problems Solved: 22</strong></p>

<p>I'm a programmer. My primary focus is Ruby, but I have also dabbled in several other languages over the years since 2008. Not going to go into detail, since it's long and boring.</p>

<p>I'm studying Social Engineering. Probably one of my favorite subjects. I don't plan to use it illegally, and I actually want to start a service to train companies on avoiding it (there are other companies like this already, but I also want in). I'm also studying social engineering because it's just plain fun to learn about.</p>

<p>I am also a writer. I am working on a series of books (title will remain undisclosed until I feel like it) that I hope to have published sometime in the future. I have written parts of several of the books, with the first of them being the most complete (the other parts are parts serving as anchored events in the story). This has been a particularly fun project for me to work on when I have spare time (which, oddly enough, is quite often right now).</p>

<p>I'm very interested in the field of psychology. I don't entirely know what drives this interest, but part of it stems from wanting to know more about Bipolar Disorder and ADHD (I have both). I also like to see how the brain works, what stimulates certain behaviors, and how people react in certain situations. I guess my biggest interest is in why we do the things we do.</p>

<p>I've been Linux (slackware circa kernel 1.2.8) as my main OS, but gradually used Windows 95 more. Initially did some system admin work in NT4, then went the direction of programming, working mostly in Access 97 (for frontend and backend) for about 2 years. After picking up DB design, moved up to MSSQL 7, with VB6 for a frontend. Designed many classic ASP apps with compiled web class ActiveX DLL's and MSSQL 2000 as the DB server. Picked up MySQL and Oracle. </p>

<p>In 2003, started full time development in VC++ with MFC. Started using subversion in combination with bugzilla for management of off-the-shelf kiosk application. In 2005, started dev in .Net 2.0 with C#. Actively develop company website transaction management in ASP.Net, with MSSQL 2005 backend.</p>

<p>Currently learning EF4 in the hope of porting a VB6 Application using an Access 2000 backend to a .Net 4 application using WPF with the MVVM pattern, and SQLite DB for backend.</p>

The computer had only LEDs and pushbutton type switches for output and input. Next I splurged and made a Big Board computer with all of 64K in RAM, a real keyboard, a real CRT, and a couple of 8-inch floppy disks. I taught myself to program in C. Not being anything close to a full-time programmer, rapid shifts between computer systems and operating systems eventually exceeded my ability to keep up. However, I approach understanding computers with experience that goes all the way back to debugging mis-connected wire-wrapped terminals, semi-functioning chips in the Big Board, etc. In other words, I may have a more tactile understanding of some things that are abstractions that play nicely with logic to those who started with a super computer in a box.</p>

Focused on front-end currently, but working in a company with lots of proprietary frameworks it tends to mean more focus on requirements honing and working directly with product. I do not work in machine learning but do have the responsibility of delivering massive amounts of data to our customers across visualizations and giant, configurable reports. I do interviews too and often train people for technical interview prep as a hobby (i.e. not for hire, not endorsed by my parent company, not with any structure or rhyme or reason, but happy to help). I am most familiar with Java and Javascript and aspire to learn C++ as done at Google, and Python.</p>

<p>I am also a part time masters student at Columbia studying computer science, with a likely focus on Machine Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Being engaged:</strong> I aspire to be an approachable person politically but will admit I have found a lot to oppose in our new president :) so I focus on training progressives to engage in constructive political dialogue, including such forgotten skills as ""listening,"" ""not calling people racist when you don't know what else is wrong with their viewpoint"" and so forth. I get plenty of practice with my own family and some of my peers! But really, we went astray with trolling Internet arguments and shouting matches at family gathering. Black lives do matter, but I personally can forgive someone if they need to sit down and talk about why and have some, ahem, skeptical questions.</p>

<p><strong>Misc hobbies</strong>: Aspiring rock climber. Mostly I complain about my climbing gym but have great access to Central Park and have followed in the Gunks. I believe in productivity-as-a-hobby and focus on writing, messing around with bullet journals, etc.</p>

<p>I am a freelance programmer based out of NYC. I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, USA and still consider it my home. I have a background in medical robotics, computer-assisted surgery, and computational biology. I currently specialize in both systems and application programming, augmented reality, simulations, and embedded devices, as well as development project management. Since moving to NYC 11 years ago, I've fallen in to working primarily with new media and tech artists doing a lot of interactivity and <a href=""http://thebaylights.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">large-scale lighting installations</a>. I consider my current job to be creating tools that allow artists to naturally express themselves through software without limiting their creativity.</p>

Should be out in the Autumn. If you want me to let you know as soon as it comes out (and get a discount code!), send me an email (address is below).</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm director at QQ Trends, a company that solves difficult data and software challenges for our clients. (We often have freelance projects, so get in touch if interested.)</p>

<p>My book, ""Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE"" is out and selling! Get it from O'Reilly here: <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030928.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030928.do</a>   Or from Amazon here: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1449371930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449371930</a> Or from any good bookseller.</p>

<p>UPDATE: looking for another part-time CSS/JS programmer. 理想は東京所在、日本語が読める方。Interesting project(s), you will definitely learn something.</p>

<p>(And, of course, please do get in touch if you have interesting challenges that you would like our world-class experts to work on!)</p>

<p>Typical work: doing fun stuff with data (fixing, mining, etc.), web sites (front and back-ends), trading strategies. Research: trading strategies, computer go, machine translation, understanding context, AI search algorithms. Languages: C++, PHP, R, javascript, and many more. </p>

<p>I'm British, living and working in Tokyo for almost 20 years. Human Languages: English, Japanese (fairly fluent, 1 kyu), some German, Chinese and Arabic.</p>

<p>(Contact me at dc at qqtrend dot com: please mention you are coming from StackOverflow, so I know it is not spam.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Easy ways to irritate me on StackExchange sites (whether my own question or someone else's): 1. Downvote without a comment (N/A if someone already left a comment and you just agree with it, of course); 2. Answer in comments. Other than that I'm a really easy-going and pragmatic guy :-)</p>

<p>I am currently teaching and developing new ways of learning independently, applied especially to programming and computational thinking.</p>

<p>It is my goal to eventually take the teacher out of the equation, and work toward dynamically organized p2p learning. I don't believe that people (no matter their age) need teachers to learn. We don’t need teachers to learn to walk, and we don’t need (or at least we shouldn’t need) teachers to keep progressing after we leave school. People need curiosity, self-confidence and a great amount of team spirit, more than anything else, in order to eventually (hopefully soon) be able to manage themselves and progress on their own.</p>

<p>I conjecture that such a learning environment can allow for faster mental and emotional growth than any teacher-controlled environment would allow. Ideally, the teacher role should be reduced to a mentor position, encouraging students, helping students practice and improve their learner and problem solving skills, create opportunities and kickstart their independent learner network. This “learner network” ideally should also include wholehearted experts, interested in helping those who can benefit from their expertise. Once such a network reaches a certain size and maturity, I conjecture that no more teachers or any sort of top-down structure will be necessary for it to keep growing and improving.</p>

<p>There are many great obstacles lying ahead, but I believe that it boils down to two major challenges: 1) Mindset (curiosity, self-confidence, team spirit, compassion, empathy, growth mindset etc.) and 2) Learning strategies (Especially: How to explore vast, open problem and learning spaces together efficiently?)</p>

<p>THE ORIGIN OF ORDER Pattiann Rogers</p>

<p>Stellar dust has settled.</p>

<p>It is green underwater now in the leaves</p>

<p>Of the yellow crowfoot. Its potentialities</p>

<p>Are gathered together under pine litter </p>

<p>As emerging flower of the pink arbutus.</p>

<p>It has gained the power to make itself again</p>

<p>In the bone-filled egg of osprey and teal.</p>

<p>One could say this toothpick grasshopper</p>

<p>Is a cloud of decayed nebula congealed and perching</p>

<p>On his female mating. The tortoise beetle,</p>

<p>Leaving the stripped veins of morning glory vines</p>

<p>Like licked bones, is a straw-colored swirl</p>

<p>Of clever gases.</p>

<p>At this moment there are dead stars seeing</p>

<p>Themselves as marsh and forest in the eyes</p>

<p>Of muskrat and shrew, disintegrated suns</p>

<p>Making songs all night long in the throats</p>

<p>Of crawfish frogs, in the rubbings and gratings</p>

<p>Of the red-legged locust. There are spirits of orbiting</p>

<p>Rock in the shells of pointed winkles</p>

<p>And apple snails, ghosts of extinct comets caught</p>

<p>In the leap of darting hare and bobcat, revolutions</p>

<p>Of rushing stone contained in the sound of these words.</p>

<p>Maybe the paths of the Pleiades and Coma clusters</p>

<p>Have been compelled to mathematics by the mind</p>

<p>Contemplating the nature of itself</p>

<p>In the motions of stars. The patterns</p>

<p>Of the starry summer night might be identical</p>

<p>To the structure of the summer heavens circling</p>

<p>Inside the skull. I can feel time speeding now </p>

<p>In all directions deeper and deeper into the black oblivion</p>

<p>Of the electrons directly behind my eyes.</p>

<p>Child of the sky, ancestor of the sky, the mind</p>

<p>Has been obligated from the beginning</p>

<p>To create an ordered universe</p>

<p>As the only possible proof</p>

<p>Of its own inheritance.</p>

<p>I work since 2008 with technology (see my <a href=""https://br.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-nascimento-765b26b7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Linkedin</strong></a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>brcontainer@yahoo.com.br</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started with web development, with client-side and server-side. In the middle of 2010 I was hired by a real estate company located in my city (with two other agencies in nearby cities) to renovate the company's internal system, as well as the site.</p>

<p>Acting today in this company, and renew systems (""code refactoring""), also developed a web browser itself (based on <a href=""https://webkit.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webkit</a>, same technology used by Safari and the first versions of Google Chrome) for use of the internal system of the company, I also created 3 mobile applications for Android exclusively for the company, being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application that accesses the internal system of the company in a simplified way.</li>
<li>Application used by engineers and architects to classify and record details about real estate and with this make market assessments.</li>
<li>Application for searching properties through addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acting as a freelancer and in the company I worked as technologies like:</p>

<p><kbd>C / C++</kbd> <kbd>PHP (OOP)</kbd> <kbd>Java (Android)</kbd> <kbd>Mysql</kbd> <kbd>PostgreSQL</kbd> <kbd>Firebird</kbd> <kbd>HTML 4.01 / HTML 5</kbd> <kbd>CSS / CSS 3</kbd> <kbd>xml / xslt / rss</kbd> <kbd>Javascript</kbd> <kbd>SEO</kbd> e <kbd>ActionScript (AS3.0)</kbd></p>

<p>I also worked on some open-source projects, taking a small part in the <a href=""https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=%20author%3Abrcontainer%20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">html2canvas</a> project and subsequently having created ""proxys"" to use with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-csharp-proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-csharp-proxy</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-python-proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-python-proxy</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-php-proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-php-proxy</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-asp-vbscript-proxy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/brcontainer/html2canvas-asp-vbscript-proxy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to other <a href=""https://github.com/brcontainer?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=source&amp;language="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">smaller open-source projects</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually with some experience I had with frameworks like <a href=""/questions/tagged/laravel"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;laravel&#39;"" rel=""tag"">laravel</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/cakephp"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cakephp&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cakephp</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/codeigniter"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;codeigniter&#39;"" rel=""tag"">codeigniter</a>
I decided to develop a <a href=""http://inphinit.github.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP framework of its own, called <strong>Inphinit</strong></a></p>

I would be a writer. Then I got a job as a developer by a fluke and that was that. I still write a bit. If I'd ended up being a writer, I'd probably still hack a bit.</p>

<p>Indeed I still hack a bit, in that there's no better way to relax after a hard day's programming than to kick back and do a bit of programming.

<p>The majority of my career has been <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb400852(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web applications</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456779(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">services</a> using <strong><a href=""http://www.asp.net/mvc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASP.NET MVC</a></strong> (<em>incl.</em> <strong><a href=""http://www.asp.net/web-api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web API</a></strong>) and <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456779.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Communication Foundation</a></strong> (WCF) in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e80y5yhx(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tandem</a> with database technologies such as <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>Apache Solr</strong> (Lucene). I also spent several years working with less common .NET technologies such as legacy <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/96bef039(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Forms</a></strong>, current-generation <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Presentation Foundation</a></strong> (WPF), and the <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838158(VS.96).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silverlight</a></strong> browser plugin.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in the .NET Framework's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156536(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unique performance characteristics</a>, due to factors like <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f144e03t(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">automatic memory management</a>, <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zcx1eb1e(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">type safety</a>, and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8a3x2b7f(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reliability guarantees</a>; further, I study practical high-performance design techniques such as <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156548(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parallelization</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997357(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caching</a>. Historically, developers have been able to ignore performance, but the advent of the cloud has changed things. Often, leveraging the cloud means taking a given task and breaking it into sub-tasks that can be processed at different speeds organically. That division of labor necessitates a better understanding of any given operation's cost. As a result, I find that my performance expertise is getting called upon more and more by my employer.</p>

<p>I'm Morwenn. You might have come across my profile near a C++ question. That wouldn't be surprising since I am almost always toying in a dark corner of your bedroom with some modern C++ features (don't be afraid :p); I gave up keeping the actual C++ version I'm using up-to-date in this description, but it should be the latest version available, any time, plus some experimental features. I sometimes try to contribute to the C++ standard and occasionally help with open-source projects.</p>

<p>When I'm not torturing templates, I develop some small scripts or applications with Python. Once in a while it doesn't hurt, and Sphinx is definitely the best thing that happened to project documentation. I also have a disturbing sorting fetish and have thus developed a generic C++14 library with many sorting algorithms, either stolen or reimplemented by myself; if you're interested, don't hesitate to <a href=""https://github.com/Morwenn/cpp-sort"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>Let's talk about hobbies now? :) I love to listen to music all day long while doing anything - psytrance is a must while programming. I also love to talk about music and to play music. I have been playing the recorder in a celtic metal band for some time now, that's plenty of fun ^^</p>

<p>Whatever, I don't know what to add. You can check my GitHub if you feel like it, there are some modern C++ libraries and other pseudo-random stuff over there. Anyway, have a good day and have fun programming, that's what matters the most! :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> if you ever want to use code from one of my questions or answers, unless that code wasn't originally mine (I generally specify where the code comes from when needed), just do whatever you want with it. Consider it to be Creative Commons CC0 licensed (public domain).</em></p>

When I was five years old, I wanted to learn how to read. Afraid that I might get bored in class if they'd allow that, my father decided to teach me how to play chess and my mother showed me how to get our Commodore 64 to repeat my name over and over.</p>

Computers have always been a big part of my life.  I've always had an interest in programming paradigms and languages as well as low-level systems design.  I enjoy reinventing the wheel, chrome plating it and adding spinners.  C# is my language of choice and aim to be sufficiently familiar with all related technologies.  My ultimate goal right now would be part of the C# compiler team or the regular .NET team.</p>

<p>Recently I've started dabbling with javascript, still have a ways to go.  Considering starting a project to write an alternative to HTML Agility Pack that more closely mimics the .NET XML library.  But first I'll have to figure out all the typical things done in HTML that would kill an XML parser.  Not really looking forward to that.  BS in Computer Engineering at UCSD.  Taught and tutored in upper division programming courses officially and unofficially, it's in my blood.</p>

<p>LINQ is AWESOME. (period)</p>

On August 1, 2017 that changed when Bitcoin hardforked to implement the first substantial network upgrade in many years. The hardfork was contentious, causing a split where both the non-forked and forked version of the coin continue to exist. The legacy version has financial backing by big banks that want to slow bitcoin adoption and has kept the name Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The upgraded version is now called Bitcoin Cash and will hardfork (non-contentiously) on a regular interval every six months, allowing the network to be upgraded without catching any node operators off guard. In the first hardfork Bitcoin Cash removed RBF so that merchants can now accept unconfirmed transactions, and increased the block size so that it can scale to support more transactions and have lower fees. The next upgrade will fix TX malleability in a much simpler way than segwit does (segwit is needlessly complex in order to avoid a hardfork) and fix it for all transactions instead of only fixing it only for segwit transactions. Many more exciting upgrades will be rolled out in the biannual hardforks.</p>

<p>Supporting Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin is a vote for the ability to upgrade the network and removing the influence of big banks.</p>

<p>I started learning to code when I was 9 years old,
<br />Made my first game when I was 10 and started selling them to class mates
<br />
<br />The Education system failed me, I don't want to learn how to use Word and Powerpoint
<br /> at school when I'm playing with Assembly  and C at home!
<br />
<br />Excluded once for hacking the schools system.
<br />Arrested once for hacking a football (soccer) webste
<br />And learnt my lesson..
<br />Now I'm a white/grey hat but try to stay away from that scene lest I get sucked in once more
<br />As soon as the first android phone came out (the G1 if anyone remembers it?)
<br />I brought one and started developing apps for myself.. then one day I thought hey,
<br />why dont I put them on the app store, at 16 I started earning a good revenue each month
<br />Untill a change in working hours at my day job (I went full time) meant I had no energy to work
<br />When I was home..
<br />I then got offered a job as a Loss Prevention officer within the same company
<br />at a different location and my business went on the back burner.
<br />
<br >
<br/>I eventually got fed up of that job role and left to travel Australia
<br >Where I met my now fiancé and found my dream job.
<br />
<br />Now all my energy goes into my business <a href=""http://ukjp-design.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UKJP-Design</a>
<br />And my current job role as senior developer.

I've worked on many different platforms including the PDP-8, PDP-10, PDP-11, TI-99 4a, Apple II, Macs, various IBM PCs and clones, Sun workstations, IBM Mainframes, and a few that I've probably forgotten. I've programed in Fortran, Pascal, APL, Lisp, Prolog, C, C++, PL/I, PL/X, Basic, various assembly languages, Java, Python, VHDL, and some special purpose languages.</p>

<p>In the early 1980, I used to ""explore"" tymnet and telenet. I was well known among the phreak community, and accidentally crashed Compuserve before most people knew what it was. After that I reformed my ways. :) I had a node on the uucpnet and got hit by the morris worm. I was one of the first people to dissect it, thus learning about how buffer overruns could be exploited. </p>

<p>Later, I hung out at PANIX (the actual physical location on 18th St.) which eventually led to me meeting my wife. One of the current stackexchange sysadmins, the one who literally wrote the book on the subject, brought my wife to a party at my apartment.</p>

<p>I wrote one of the first protocol decoders for wireshark (back when it was ethereal) and have written several more protocol decoders for various packet analysis tools including HTTP and SSL. I've broken one (albeit poorly designed) encryption algorithm, designed an encryption algorithm optimization for use in an embedded device.</p>

<p>I have degrees in electrical engineering, but have spent my most of my professional career developing software. I've also worked on the I/O subsystem design of mainframe computers back in the day, and ran my own network engineering company.</p>

<p>My dissertation topic was on covert communication channels, including early Stenographic work using direct sequence spread spectrum. I've also did research on semi-fragile digital signatures for multimedia data, radiological telemedicine, and digital imaging, as I had grants from The College of Physicians and Surgeon at Columbia University and Kodak. </p>

<p>I head up a group responsible for developing the authentication modules for a network equipment manufacturer. I also am the chair of the CTO's working group on AAA and security.</p>

<p>I'm a reserve military officer and have served as a Brigade S6 officer (communication and IT).</p>

<p>My current interest areas include security of VMs, especially where the hypervisor has been partially compromised, cyberwarfare, and extremely low bit rate covert channels (ELBRCCs)for the control of malware and data exfiltration. One of the types of ELBRCCs that I'm most interested in is where there are long period where the channel is closed to traffic and infrequent periods where it is open with very high latencies. A typical example would be an air-gap where periodically someone moves a USB stick across the gap and back.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm sort of like Hiro Protagonist from Snow Crash, but with less pizza delivery :).</p>

My first experience was with Vampire The Masquerade and then a bit of 3.5 D&amp;D. I didn't fully get into the hobby until 2012 when a friend started a 4e campaign and invited me to play and I dove in. I currently play 4e, 13th Age, Savage Worlds and Colonial Marines. I try to read up on as many RPG mechanics as I can and look forward to trying more RPGs in the future.</p>

<p>My background before RPGs comes from video games, board games, and war games before I played RPGs.</p>

In the past I have worked on creating programs using <a href=""http://www.computercraft.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">Computercraft</a> for Minecraft, <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiremod</a> for Garry's Mod and Space Engineers. I am currently assisting a friend with writing games for the <a href=""https://www.arduboy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Arduboy</a>.</p>

<p>I started learning programming in late 2011, in college they taught us VisualBasic.Net, but I soon started learning C# in my own free time, followed later by <a href=""https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Lua</a> and <a href=""http://izquotes.com/quotes-pictures/quote-c-makes-it-easy-to-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-c-makes-it-harder-but-when-you-do-it-blows-away-bjarne-stroustrup-351957.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">C++</a>. Now I mostly use C# and C++, but I'm also reasonably good with Lua and Java. I'm currently learning <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Haskell</a> and Python on and off. I have varying experience with <a href=""http://ss64.com/nt/syntax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Batch</a>, <a href=""http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/"" rel=""nofollow"">Brainfuck</a>, <a href=""http://strlen.com/false/false.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">FALSE</a>, <a href=""http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/551.jvn.fall01/primer.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">FORTH</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Larry_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">Perl</a> and Powershell.</p>

<p>I can use VB.Net and GML (gamemaker language), but I <strike>would rather smash my foot with a shovel</strike> prefer not to. I am vehemently against the teaching of VB.Net and GML in schools and believe that C#, Java and C++ should be taught instead. I'm also accepting of Python but I think Lua is easier to get to grips with.</p>

<p>I have varying levels of experience with many computer-oriented subjects including computer architecture, compiler theory, operating systems and threading. I am familiar with the C++ standard library, the .Net standard library, and SDL 2.</p>

<p>I'm working intensively with C++11, getting (Almost trying to learn) good modern C++ practices.<br>
I'm specially interested in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming"" rel=""nofollow"">C++ template-metaprogramming</a>, my current main project is <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/Turbo"" rel=""nofollow"">a library to provide <strong>compile-time utilities using tmp</strong></a>.<br>
Also I'm currently working on a unit testing library for template metaprograms. I really hate to test my metaprograms with <code>static_assert()</code>s only! <em>(Insert future github project link here)</em><br>
I like a lot to play with the language, exploting its capabilities until (Sadly...) the compiler colapses with an internal error.</p>

<p>But not everything are crazy ideas. I have more realistic projects. For example, as a result of my personal frustration with C++ tuples, I'm currently writting a library to enance the capabilities of C++11 tuples, making the day to day work easy: <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/TTL"" rel=""nofollow"">The TTL Project</a>.</p>

<h3>But that was not always the case...</h3>

<p>My career as programmer started with Visual Basic 6.0, and a bit later with Visual Basic .NET. A couple of years later I decided to ""port my mind"" to the world of C#, C++, and C. 
That decision have leaded to a wonderfull world of OO programming with C#, close to metal C, and C++ generic programming.</p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in videogame programming, specifically game-engine implementations,
so I have worked with DirectX, such as in <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/cpp_lib32"" rel=""nofollow"">my port</a> of the <a href=""https://github.com/VisualStudioEX3/dx_lib32"" rel=""nofollow"">dx_lib32 project</a>.<br>
Before that I have written a <strong>GDI+ based 3d rendering engine from scratch</strong>, using VB.NET and C#.  </p>

<p>Also I have written ""experimental"" projects using C# and the Kinect for Windows SDK, such as <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectNormalMap"" rel=""nofollow"">a 3d scanner <strong>to compute normal maps and render the scene</strong> at ""real time""</a>, or a simple <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/KinectStick"" rel=""nofollow"">videogame-oriented virtual keyboard which provides <strong>speech and gesture based commands</strong></a>.</p>

<h3>What about Java?</h3>

<p>I really hate the Java programming language (Please note that I said <em>the programming language</em>, not the runtime nor the libraries). It suffers from years of unresolved design errors from its base, a horrible and verbose syntax, and years of not evolving at all (I know about Java 8, but think: That was which C# has 8 years before...). </p>

<p>As you can see I strongly prefer C# as a OO VM-based language (""Managed"", as Microsoft likes to say), but Java is a very common language in the programming world.<br>
So, even if I hate Java, I have an intermediate-low level with it. Thats what I think, but <a href=""https://github.com/Manu343726/WALLE"" rel=""nofollow"">judge by yourselves instead</a>. Also check this SO profile about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:1609356+[java]"">the Java questions I answered</a>.</p>

<p>Hello. You showed up in my review queue. You will be reviewed and re-tagged if necessary. Failure to comply may result in harm.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a wolf. Awoo.</p>

<p>One-day moderator hopeful for Ask Ubuntu (but that seems <strong><em>highly</em></strong> unlikely).</p>

<hr>

<p>Sysadmin for a few companies. I also write some Java code, and I do some Python. If you need me, swing by the <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/201/ask-ubuntu-general-room"">AskUbuntu General Room</a>. Or ask for me in the Bridge (please don't).</p>

<p>If you want to talk to me over e-mail for some reason, shoot a message to:
<code>[username] (at) linux.com</code>. Please don't spam me.</p>

<p><strong>Notable Achievements</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ragequit AskUbuntu twice, promising never to come back. I did.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href=""https://github.com/KazWolfe/WolfBot-SE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WolfBot</a>. And abandoned it. And then went back to working on it.</li>
<li>Abused the hell out of chat, numerous times.</li>
<li>Played video games.</li>
<li>Managed to nuke an entire Linux install, live.</li>
<li>Reddit.</li>

<p>1). Set a goal what you wish to program..</p>

<p>2). Make your program just work. (don't worry think much how messy your coding is.)</p>

<p>3). Fix all bugs you can find and do tests on each part to make sure no more bugs exist.</p>

<p>I am a cybersecurity professional, with the following certifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security+ CE</li>
<li>Linux+</li>
<li>Windows 7 Configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>I find cyber security to be a field that is under rapid development, and one that is very important to our future.  It has many interesting aspects as well.  </p>

<p>It seems most people underestimate the importance of cyber security.  I too used to underestimate its importance, but now I know better and I want people to know how important cyber security really is.  I can provide plenty of examples of why it is important, and here is a brief list (certainly not comprehensive):</p>

<ul>
<li>If a cyber criminal gets access to your bank account, you could loose your hard earned money.  Watch out for scam e-mails that might even claim to be your bank.  Do not provide your password to anyone.</li>
<li>Infrastructure needs to be protected, or cyber criminals could do massive damage.</li>
<li>If you are a business, a competitor could hack into your system and learn your secrets to success and run you out of buisiness.  Having good cyber security measures in place will help protect your valuable secrets.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to see more automation, more secure default setups, better tools, and better practices / policies that make cyber security more effective and easy to implement.  The future of the world literally could depend on it!</p>

<p><strong>Other Stuff:</strong></p>

<p>I also know a wide variety of programming languages (most proficient with C++), and program professionally as well.</p>

<p>I am also a Christian, and I like to study science as a hobby.</p>

<p>If you have a concern that pertains to moderation on either of those sites and would like to speak with me in private, feel free to flag a post (preferably a related one to your concern, but flagging your own post will do if that doesn't apply) using the ""Other..."" reason and I or one of my fellow moderators can open a private chat room for us.</p>

<p>My amateur radio call sign is KF7WLP.</p>

<p>I've been programming since I was eight, working on several projects during that time, some for fun and some for pay (which, you know, is also fun). I'm now dev lead at Haugen Applications, a company my father founded a while back in Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>

<p>I tend to take the ""a little knowledge about a lot of things"" route in computer science, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to new technologies so I find I can get the hang of fairly advanced topics in little enough time that I can pretend I know what I'm talking about. With that said, I currently have no formal training in CS so most of what I know is from experience and reading. My working rule of thumb is that I'd rather be able to go to university without student loans and for fun than do it because I'm supposed to and find myself in huge amounts of debt and at the same job when I get out.</p>

<p>Day-to-day, I use C# and T-Sql mostly with some JavaScript here and there. I also have working proficiency in Java and C++, and I'm probably forgetting a few in the mix. Most of what I do these days is web-related, both through writing websites and writing (and on some rare occasions, reading) APIs. I used to live and breathe Windows Forms, but something magical happened at some point in my life and I moved on from them.</p>

<p>I have been accepted as a SANS Mentor, and am GWEB (a GIAC certification for Secure PHP Development) and GWAPT (a GIAC Web Application Penetration Testing certification) certified.  I am currently going through the OSCP materials, and have my OSCP examination set up for March of 2017.</p>

<p>I speak at conferences regarding developer work-flow, security with respect to being a developer (not just Ops), and how to utilize and develop your own tools.  Next up, I will be giving a talk at UMSA for their April 2017 WebTrax conference.  The will be my ""Security in the Grind"" presentation, which has a solid reputation for being engaging as well as informative.</p>

<p>I spent several years in the trenches of Miva Merchant development, both in template scripting as well as module development.  While Miva Merchant is a well-performing e-commerce platform, there definitely is a lack of open documentation for independent developers. So, when I left Miva development, I rebranded and open-sourced my modules for the community and merchants alike.</p>

<p>In development, I have a passion for pair-programming when it makes sense, TDD / BDD, continuous integration, version control, kanban/scrum, peer-reviews, frequent deployment, and cross-team collaboration.</p>

So I touched to many languages from C to Javascript, including PHP, Perl, FORTRAN, with different platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac) and software (MS Office, Matlab, scientific projects) and made a lot of user support.
I now start an independent activity and focuses on helping users to enhance their experience with computers with my software.</p>

which of the many doctypes will be best to use<br/>
I’ll want RDFA if I am integrating with social media<br/></p>

<p>no longer just html version one<br/>
learning each new language is just so much fun<br/>
some languages have died and been superseded<br/></p>

<p>they live on in carefully maintained archives<br/>
they linger on in forgotten dust coat hard drives<br/>
indeed CERN has resurrected the very first public website<br/></p>

<p>I always use two languages at least<br/>
css can make everything a visual feast<br/>
while html provides the bones<br/></p>

<p>I always follow the standards the doctypes supply<br/>
I treat the the IETF RFCs like gods up on high<br/>
I’ve got the w3c validators on my bookmarks toolbar<br/></p>

<p>I code freehand just me and the code<br/>
Nothing that might obfuscate any node<br/>
Gives me power and control<br/></p>

<p>I'm no good at French but hey<br/>
I'm fluent in<br/>
xml<br/>
html<br/>
javascript<br/>
tescript<br/>
css one two and three<br/>
the awesomeness that is php<br/></p>

<p>One day I'll learn French but for today<br/>
I'm happy to play with sql tables<br/>
they are fun just like good fables<br/></p>

<p>I love to cook and I love to experiment. I have some small professional experience (chief cook and bottle washer), a certain little Alaskan town loved my dinner specials. I often think that I should have gone to culinary school, but I didn't. Maybe I'll audition for Masterchef someday. In the meantime, I'll continue to experiment. I love the internet.</p>

<p>Just in case you're here wondering what pronoun to use, I'm a ""she"".</p>

<p>I'm critical of the SE system and mentality.  SE seems to encourage this idea of cannonical answers, and doesn't encourage discussion.  Discussion is one of the best ways for people to learn, and is especially useful when there's no clear answers,or answers aren't entirely appropriate.  The gamification of SE is also clearly broken.</p>

<p>I've found one other person who've come to very similar conclusions explained <a href=""http://michael.richter.name/blogs/awhy-i-no-longer-contribute-to-stackoverflow"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  Mr. Richter does a far better job at explaining the things I've only got a toehold on.  Here's a teaser that I found especially insightful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This changed slowly but surely in the way that all ""community
  moderated"" things change.  Here is the recipe that all such
  ""community-driven"" approaches almost, but not quite, invariably
  follow:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>A wide-open community based on ""merit"" is built. </li>
  <li>The community gets a
  kernel of users who build up ""merit"" by virtue of, basically, being
  obsessive twerps. </li>
  <li>As this kernel of ""serious"" users builds up its
  influence, they start to modify what the standards of the community
  are to match their own desires. </li>
  <li>These standards get enforced on other
  members of the community who lack sufficient ""merit"" (read: who have a
  life outside the site) to fight back.</li>
  <li>The tenor of the community
  changes to match the notions of the obsessive, but ""meritous""
  minority. </li>
  <li>Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, I enjoy parts of the SE community, and still learn something from the Security community here, so the deep flaws are worth the benefits.</p>

Whatever there is to learn has to be learned the hard way.

Everything new in our lives, such as the concepts I am teaching you, must be repeated to us to the point of exhaustion before we open ourselves to it.</p>

<p>Said that,</p>

<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>

<p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<p>Simple is better than complex.</p>

<p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>

<p>Flat is better than nested.</p>

<p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>

<p>Readability counts.</p>

<p>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</p>

<p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>

<p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>

<p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>

<p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>

<p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>

<p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general. Despite this, I <em>hate</em> school (can't really learn there).</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I'm learning Rust, with a bit of C on the side so I can understand how to use pointers better.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>Lua</li>

<p>The StackExchange sites can be a great place to share knowledge and learn new things.</p>

<p>Due to some rude and inappropriate moderating of the Superuser StackExchange site (a sentiment unfortunately shared by quite a few people), I regret that I will be limiting my contributions there.  I do not share those values.  Hopefully things will improve.</p>

<p>The other StackExchange sites seem to attract much better quality and more friendly moderators, and thus have healthier communities.</p>

It started out with a general computer interest and the need to know how and why something works. This interest has continued to grow but instead of dissecting computer hardware and removing viruses from friends computers all day long my focus has changed to IT security and programming. The programming language that I prefer is C#. On my spare time I like to do small (and large) technology projects. This can be everything from creating an RFID-reader or 3D printer using an Arduino to participating in vulnerability bounty programs. </p>

<p>Another big interest is also my entrepreneurial side. I like to see something grow and instead of just seeing obstacles I try to see possibilities. After being a part of several start-ups and having an amazing time working with different projects I look forward to bring my competence and drive into a larger company where I can focus and evolve.</p>

<p>I am a Male Carbon-based life form (though I used to be a member of the Q continuum, but was banished). My home planet (now) is called ""Earth"", it is located in Galactic sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. And I am now now part of a species known as ""Human"". I also understand <a href=""https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/20860/how-to-best-upgrade-your-towel-for-military-combat"">the importance of Towels</a> and <a href=""https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/19669/how-to-deal-with-a-friendly-boghog-without-hurting-it-and-maintaining-a-positiv"">how to handle friendly Boghogs</a>.</p>

<p>Our local planning department is located in the Alpha Centauri solar system, which is 4 light years away from our home planet.</p>

<p>Our planet has been categorised by the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard of) as ""Mostly Harmless"".</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a mom (of a toddler) with a wide range of hats. No, not the actual hats. More the ""hi, someone needs to figure out how to get this done and then do it"" type. Things like ""ok, we bought it, now how <em>do</em> we put a new vanity in?"" or ""help, the daughter is getting into things she shouldn't."" Wait, that sounds a lot like work, too. </p>

<p>I have a background ranging from formal education in computer science to training in fine arts… as well as electronics once upon a time (I still break out the soldering iron now and then and have wanted to find time to do some microcontroller based work)… and even ranging to medieval literature. I help my wife with critiques, advice, and sometimes even direct work with her graphic illustration business, <a href=""http://www.ladytankstudios.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">LadyTank Studios</a>, and still dream of some day putting out a video game or two.</p>

<p>I try to be a polymath: I like to think (even though I know I'm not actually that great) that I know less about most things than an expert in that topic, but that I understand just about everything more than the average person.</p>

<p>I am a very strange person, so my favorite programming languages are C and Bourne shell. I also find assembly enjoyable, and often find myself wishing that C was more of ""abstract, portable assembly"" than it is. But I know my way around a bunch of other programming languages, just as you'd expect from a remotely decent programmer.</p>

<p>In a perfect world I'd also write a C-like programming language one day which provided good syntactical support for late-time linking, self-modification, etc (where the compiler would do its best to optimize for the target machine's instruction caching behavior, etc). I think this could be especially powerful for kernel-level optimizations (e.g. a kernel could dynamically generate just the pieces of its file handling code relevant for the usecase a process has in that moment, chopping out the unneeded logic - I'm sure smarter people than me with more kernel development experience could think of more, better examples), but presently, such code has to be written in architecture-specific assembly, which keeps it from being viable.</p>

<p>I put my code that I think is useful for others onto my personal GitHub repository, even when it's something really tiny and simple. I also try my best to avoid the tendency a lot of people have of saying ""I'll put my code up when it's cleaned up"", which in my experience is a great way to end up never getting around to putting your code up for others, so I err on the side of open sourcing kludge-y/bad code first, regardless of when I get around to cleaning it up.</p>

<p>I am also the kind of person who, after writing this, thinks: ""I really should put this text on GitHub so I have one version controlled place for it where I can link people to.""</p>

<p>No matter who you are, no matter how bad or good your current situation is, you <strong>must thrive</strong>, you must keep doing the hard work. <strong>Respect</strong> the other person you are talking to, because you do not know how hard time he is going through.</p>

<p>And I believe, if you want to get more, <em>you need to deserve more</em>. Life will give you what you deserve, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've stopped arguing with people on SE because everyone is so righteous. Please people: calm down, and open your mind a bit.</p>

<p>On many of the large SE sites such as SuperUser and StackExchange, you have to go through three ass holes to find one person who is truly willing to help.</p>

  <p>A Good advice by <strong><a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/5565018#5565018"">Gordon</a></strong> If you want to become an expert programmer, google SOLID, buy GOF, buy POEAA, buy Clean Code, learn Refactoring, lookup GRASP, DDD, CQRS, DCI … but dont ask for PHP books. That's the most reasonable suggestion I can give you when you ask for Expert PHP books really.</p>

<p>My first distro was Slackware, which I quickly broke. I then went back to Windows 95. After that, my friend helped me install Debian, which I used until I replaced that machine. I found Debian too difficult to install on my own, so I put Red Hat on my newer machine. At that time, <code>yum</code> didn't exist, and Red Hat only offered updates if I logged in to X as root, which I rarely did. So, it quickly became outdated, and OpenOffice 1.1 couldn't handle right-to-left text, which I needed for one of my university classes. So, I started using my Windows XP laptop most of the time. I couldn't install Linux on the laptop because the NTFS tools of the era couldn't resize my partition.</p>

<p>After a couple of years, I decided to switch my Red Hat box to something more modern. I wanted to move away from the RPM package format, so I tried installing Debian again and once again found it too complicated to get all the features I needed. Then, I read about an up and coming Debian-based distro called Ubuntu that had just released their latest version. So, I installed 6.06 (Dapper Drake) and have used Ubuntu exclusively as my main OS all my machines since that time. I only boot into Windows a few times a year. I've tried a few other distros' live CDs, but so far have always decided that the benefits of those distros aren't significant enough for me to switch over.</p>

<p>For the first many years, I used the command line most of the time, as early Linux GUIs weren't up to many basic tasks. These days, the GUI tools have made leaps and bounds and are quite usable. Nevertheless, I often prefer the command line for many tasks. I'm much more likely to use <code>vim</code> than Gedit. But, I quite appreciate GUI tools for a number of tasks--perhaps most tasks these days.</p>

<p>The real problem behind the ""not for extensive discussions"" thing is probably that some answers on some subsites tries to appear formal and complete, while in fact, nobody knows an ideal answer. It could be still understandable on Workspace, but obviously horrible on Parenting. Answers on some other websites that nobody ever wanted a discussion usually tries to appear informal to acknowledge that ""this might not be the perfect answer, but hope it has helped you a bit"". On the other hand, they are more permissive to personal opinions and duplicates, instead, as a result. Alternatively, they simply don't have a commenting feature, but visible downvotes, to acknowledge that this answer is not verified by many.</p>

<p>About 3 years ago I've joined the SO community. I was (and still am) learning about webdevelopment. SO taught me that you'll get the greatest rewards for learning and putting efford in the job yourself. Whenever I was able to clearly explain what I've tried so far and why it didn't help me out, the community was always there to help me out. I wanted to return that favor and be part of that community instead of only taking advantage of it. Although there are questions which are to complicated for me, there's also a lot of them I can easily answer. To me SO is all about programmers helping eachother out in time of need. Whether your skills are that of a professional or a beginner, doing the best you can is all what the community would like to see from you.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hobby: I like to fly in private aircraft (passenger or supernumerary crew) and I do it several times a year sometimes by arrangement and sometimes by ""hitchhiking"" at private fields. By arrangement I do stuff like baby sitting, pet delivery, chaperoning, translating, mock landing interviews, and gift delivery. The furthest east I have been is London -> Samarkand (single engine Cherokee). The furthest west I have been is London -> Los Angeles (many different aircraft, including a G650). The most stressful are the landings at Nuuk to refuel.  The easiest airport to ""hitch"" a ride is in Texas USA.</p>

<p>I am a professional programmer currently working as Java Developer and Technical Mentor in India. As most of you here I love learning new things. Complex problem solving and Algorithms Development are my areas of interest and I love exploring new ways of implementing things. As a programmer I endorse  no-nonsense way of programming (no-wastage or memory etc.) and try to code straight to the point. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe that software shouldn't abuse power of computing hardware
  (i.e. RAM, CPU etc) and for that we as a programmer must behave wisely
  in spending every single byte of RAM and every CPU cycle that code
  will spend.</p>

  <p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

  <p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

  <p>Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use. Know what I mean? My newest favourite acronym fits nicely: <strong><code>A.S.S., Always Stay Skeptical</code></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>PicResize: free tool to batch resize pictures, and if aspect ratios don't match between the initial resolution and the output, the user can decide what it'll do. It can apply a blur border, a solid border, stretch to fit, or auto-fix the output to it matches up correctly.</li>
<li>TrigHelper: free tool that can do a bunch of functions related to Trigonometry.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've made other apps for Windows PCs, and some of them are old and outdated. I can't edit them anymore due to past problems with my PC's hard drive. They still, however, work.</p>

<p>I've released a game onto the iOS App Store, named ""Throw, Catch, Throw!"". You throw a ball into the air and catch it.</p>

<p>I plan on releasing some applications for that platform as well. These include the two I made for Windows PCs that I described above, and a couple others:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Pet Rock: ...that's self-explanatory.</li>
<li>10,000 Floors of Doom: a full-fledged 2D game. I'm going to release the Pet Rock app first.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as programming/developing goes, the PC apps have been written in Visual Basic using Visual Studio 2010, 2012, and 2013. Each of them require .NET 4.0. I know how to program in C#, and for iOS, I'm familiar with Objective-C and the use of SpriteKit/SceneKit.</p>

<p>If it counts for anything, I also know HTML. I know the foundation of CSS and JavaScript, but I'm a bit rusty on those two, and I might have to look online for more info about that.</p>

<p>I haven't yet taken any classes for programming; I looked online for stuff. I will take a Computer Science class at Corning Community College, and I might take a class at RIT if things go well, and if I have the money.</p>

<p>I'm also a learning photographer. My gallery is available on an iCloud photo stream (link on my website) and on Instagram at @dan_dalton_ . If you follow me on there, I'll follow back. :)</p>

It should look appear as if you're using the selector, it should refrain from using inline JavaScript, it will be as tall as it to be the same size as it queries the DOM once more text. Inline elements will be vertically centered in reference to the parent element. There are much better to use <code>Event.preventDefault()</code> in the <code>Element.onkeydown</code> property and then check to see if that cookie is already set a translucent white background. Bootstrap >= 3.3.0 In Bootstrap version 3.3.0 there are CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is no reason not to. Are not selecting the submit button, you can select it using javascript. Create a new function to Check the width of the containing block. However, you can fake it. You can use display: table-cell and vertical-align: middle The vertical-align CSS property specifies the popover will be shown in front of the the image. This means that you're no longer hovering over the image, the popover will be overwritten by the subsequent rule as it queries the DOM once more information on corrections not specified in. This is a very simple thing to do. Find out what the original position of the div. If the scroll position is clicked, do nothing If the 2nd radio button is clicked, check the list items to display: inline-block and hide the overflow of .carousel. To achieve this effect, instead wrap the containing div element. This will happen. Note: This is does not necessary. Create two nodes 'node1' and script layout to make it more than the above solution. Apply the event listener to the image is hidden, which causes you can take advantage of another CSS properties named overflow-y, overflow-x and simply overflow. In this case there is greater then 768, set the variable at the beginning of the script like this to only execute the popover will be shown in front! You to be hovering over the image (to the bottom of the page). Use I'm not quite sure what that regex is supposed to do, but I am assuming that you're trying to only allow the background to continue across, wrap the container and apply the background color to the wrapper. One month's worth of milliseconds. insert a new div element with <code>display:inline-block</code> and <code>vertical-align: middle</code> then all of those elements using only CSS See the code corrections section below for more information on the client side, but first has to have a set height. What does that mean for maintaining aspect ratio? What this means is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, session?</p>

<p>Prior to studying for a Masters degree in EE, I was a hobbyist in electronics and had been for many years - I started programming with Lego Mindstorms when I was little and slowly worked my way into building electronic kits and then on to designing circuits. I taught myself PCB design and much of the practical aspects of circuit design when digitising a model railway that I have on my windowsill (block detection, control of points, signals, etc.).</p>

<p>It wasn't until going to university that in being taught the fundamentals of circuit design and theory that I started having much more success with my hobby and am now turning that into a career in electronics. Having learnt to program in C/C++ during my first year at Uni, I moved on and taught myself to program in Verilog and work with FPGAs - digital logic circuitry being my main area of interest.</p>

<p>For my Masters year I developed an FPGA based data transfer system based around a low level PCIe IP core (Altera) and in the process taught myself how to write Windows KMDF drivers and DLLs. In fact this project landed me a job at Georgia Tech where I continued development of the system and have since turned it into a Ultrasound Imaging Platform which is configurable enough to be useful in many other research areas including medical research and industrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Hi! I'm Jeff.</strong> I am currently an engineer on Google Maps for Android in Mountain View, CA, though my opinions and advice are my own. In my personal time, I enjoy lindy hop swing dancing, photography, aviation (as a private pilot), and organizing furry conventions.</p>

<p>Though I like helping with any answers I can, I am found most often on StackOverflow. I particularly like helping debug and explain <strong>Guice</strong>, <strong>Dagger</strong>, and <strong>Mockito</strong>, which I count as some of the most-powerful (and sometimes least-intuitive) packages available in Java today.</p>

<p>My five favorite computer science inventions: Code-generating serialization layers (Protocol Buffers and Thrift), Bloom filters, Hilbert indexes, A* search, and CompactHashSet. I'm also a fan of DI and mocking frameworks, as you can see above. :)</p>

<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>

<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

I managed to reverse engineer existing code to learn how to create new things. It's 10 years later now, and I know 9ish languages. Right now though I'm focusing on Clojure because it's just a fantastic language. Unfortunately, I have very little, if any experience with frameworks. Since I'm just a hobbyist, I've always found it more rewarding to do everything ""the hard way"". </p>

I was born in Ithaca, NY, and studied biomechanical engineering and engineering physics there at Cornell, before getting my M.Sc. Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands. I am here because I love people and I want them to excel.</p>

<p>Most of the ideas in my answers are carefully crafted, and where they explode in complexity it is usually because I don't know a less-complex way to fully express the point. There are usually short-hand steps in the middle that I use may run over your head. If you're reading this for any reason, <strong>please feel free</strong> to ask me in comments to ""dumb down"" these sorts of details; and I will do my best. There are usually easier ways to explain special cases and stuff.</p>

<p>So, for example, the work-energy theorem <em>can</em> be worked out, in a limited sense, with <em>plain middle-school algebra</em>: but if you know vectors and calculus, the ""differential"" form (P = dK/dt) is much easier and clearer to start with, and the work-energy theorem is just the time-integral of that. So I will tend towards the ""easy/clear"" version with vectors and calculus: but if you don't know vectors and calculus, you're going to miss out! If you are reading this because that has happened, <strong>ask me in comments</strong> for the lower-skill-level explanation, and I will try to give you that middle-school algebra version.</p>

<p>(But, for your own good, learn vectors and calculus. It is a tragedy that people try to teach physics without some ""0th-year-course"" on those topics. In fact college courses seem to reteach the same stuff year after year at all skill levels, just because they don't want to set aside a prerequisite freshman course on the subject to teach it to everyone together.)</p>

<p>I joined Stack Exchange so I could commit to the proposal for Mi Yodeya.  I ask lots of questions to learn from the many knowledgeable Yodeyans.  My answers tend to be to practical ""Jewish life"" questions.</p>

<p>Professionally, I'm a technical writer who works with (and often helps design) programming interfaces.  I'd love to see more tech-writing questions on <a href=""http://writers.stackexchange.com/"">Writers.SE</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a Jew and considering participating on the Biblical Hermeneutics SE site, I urge you to <a href=""http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/3457/gone-quiet"">consider these words from someone who went down that path</a>. They want Jews to help out on their site, but they don't want to rein in the Christian evangelism so we'll feel welcome. That's at best distasteful. Proceed with caution, and ideally consult your rabbi first. (<a href=""http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/1807/472"">More info on our meta</a>.)

I am an experienced accountant and consider that the most likely of the decent-paying jobs I might get.</p>

<p>I program as a hobby and as my major in my BS.  I would prefer over any other job to find work in programming, but I have the chicken-egg problem.  No experience, so no offers.  I love C# most of all, am learning ASM and fighting my way through many frustrations with it, and often model projects in Python first, use it as my road map when building it in C# or ASM for speed.  I have programmed in C++ (wrote an implementation of Pollard Rho in C++ and posted it here on Stack Overflow under a different account a few years back for example), but the lack of vowels and the surplus of underscores and other punctuation has really soured me on it.  What in the world is a Decklespeck anyway?  Oh wait.  IFNDEF Decklespeck DEF Decklespeck ENDIF.  Whew that was helpful!  LOL!  Oh well, don't get upset.  I realize C++ is a fantastic language.  I just never did wrap my head around that one so well.</p>

<p>So anyway, yeah.  C#, ASM, and Python are my big 3.  Behind those are Java, Visual Basic and HTML which I realize is not an actual language.  For all my bashing it, I will probably try C++ again, and will likely learn Javascript at some point as well.</p>

A few years later I applied these skill to write my first ‘database’ application for the Salida youth crisis relief center. The application used VB6 and flat files on an FTP server to mimic a real database. Around the same time I wrote my first game, a two player top-down shooter. A year later I rewrote the database application in C#, now using a real database (MySQL) which allowed users to really work together. This application is still used daily by approximately 20 people at Stichting Cardan.</p>

<p>Since 2008 I started focusing on games. In 2008 I discovered Microsoft’s XNA framework (a managed DirectX wrapper for PC, Xbox and Windows Phone). Since then I’ve been an active member of the XNA community. While I was learning the framework and general game development techniques I started keeping <a href=""http://roy-t.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">a blog</a>. At this blog I periodically post tutorials and code snippets. I also wrote a few tutorials for popular XNA sites like www.ziggyware.com (now defunct) and <a href=""http://madgamedev.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.sgtconker.com</a> (renamed to MadGameDev). With these tutorials I won a couple of prizes.</p>

<p>In 2010 I met a few game designers and artists working on the game <a href=""http://www.hollandiagame.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Hollandia</a>. They had just won a Dutch Game Award but their programmer was unable to continue working on the game engine, which caused the project to stall. I rewrote most of their engine and coupled it to an existing physics framework. Around the same time I worked with a 15 man strong team on an extensive web shop project for Q-Free. We developed a process that automatically pulled new releases from source control and integrated them into our web shop.</p>

<p>While finishing up my Bsc. in Computing Science I worked at Science LinX (2009-2012) where I grew from a system administrator to serious game developer with a diverse set of responsibilities, from building exhibits to managing projects.</p>

<p>January 2015 I graduated Cum Laude and I now poses a master's degree from Utrecht University. During my master I also I interned at Abbey Games (creators of Reus). Currently I work as a programmer for SilverFit where I use the Kinect camera to help the elderly recover or stay fit.</p>

In the past few years though, I've been tinkering with game development and that's how I ended up here.</p>

<p>I am a business school assistant professor, and I received my PhD in operations research. My research interests involve data-driven decision making in the healthcare space, with a focus on designing combination drug therapies for advanced cancer and on designing population screening strategies for cancer.</p>

<p>On Stack Overflow, I'm most active in <a href=""/questions/tagged/mathematical-optimization"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mathematical-optimization&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mathematical-optimization</a> (where I am the first recipient of a bronze badge) and <a href=""/questions/tagged/r"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;"" rel=""tag"">r</a>. I most enjoy answering questions that either deal with code optimization or mathematical optimization. My favorite answer I've contributed so far has this flavor:</p>

<h1>Why we're here</h1>

<p>The vision of Stack Exchange is important, and worth fighting for; our fight is not against each other, but against stagnation and fatigue. Do not become weary of doing well; and do not become content with your personal best!</p>

<p>If you're new, reach deep, learn (and then teach), and do more. If you're senior, train up others to complement or succeed you. Above all, let us celebrate our success! We're a community of competent, driven scholars: we have the best questions <em>and</em> the best answers!</p>

<h1>Why I'm here</h1>

<p>I like to think I am sharing in the experience of others here on Stack Exchange. I search for the perspective of others; and I take away value each time I visit; in turn, I hope to shape the experience of others in a positive way: by giving useful feedback, cajoling newcomers into constructive creators, and reminding senior members to continue giving the best of their experience&nbsp;&mdash; and the benefit of doubt.</p>

<h1>Who I am</h1>

<p>I recently discovered photography, and used a couple mirrors to take a selfie of taking a selfie. (Thus, my avatar.) As you can see, I'm always looking for a new creative outlet, and I enjoy puns entirely too much! My variety of hobbies (ranging from needlepoint to theatre) makes me relatable to a wide variety of persons: if I haven't tried it already, then I plan to at some point, and you're the perfect person to introduce me to it!</p>

<p>I have 15 years of programming under my belt - with 10 years actually working as a Software Developer for various different companies, with 8 of those as a team leader - focusing mostly on the Microsoft Stack, in special C# and SQL Server.</p>

<p>Currently I'm the tech and team lead for a small but really awesome team of devs. We work on several projects that deal with a wide selection of domains - Human Resources, Finances, Logistics, Colorimetry, Research, Analytics, and many other cool stuff. </p>

<p>Programming is somewhat of a family business to me. Every one of the kids of my Great-Gramps ended up in IT sooner or later, with several of their sons and daughters also joining the IT fray in one form or another. My grandfather was the one that inspired me to join software development and taught me how to develop systems for DBASE III when I was really little, and since them I've been doing software both as a hobby and as a job. </p>

<p>I went trough college for Computer Science and started working on the field as an intern on the same semester I hit college, doing a lot of advanced math work that honestly shouldn't have been given to an intern. I learned that college wouldn't really prepare me better than real-life experiences on the my field, so I started learning every single thing I could for everyone I worked with - my peers, my bosses, colleagues from different departments... I found out that I love to learn stuff, and I strive to learn at least one new thing every day.</p>

<p>I also have around 10 years of Dungeon Mastering experience - mostly with d20 systems, especially D&amp;D 3.X and Pathfinder. </p>

<p>Currently, I'm running a Shadowrun game every other week using mostly skype to conduct my games. </p>

<p>I'm also a long time gamer and World of Wacraft/Starbound player.</p>

I love the problem-solving aspects of programming and the satisfaction that comes from developing a clean, clever, and efficient solution to a challenge.</p>

<p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Mathematics minor from UCCS, and several years of professional programming experience. I find software development in a professional environment to be extremely fulfilling, especially when you can see the positive effects of something you have created.</p>

<p>I desire to constantly be sharpening and honing my craft while expanding my knowledge with new technologies and languages; and I'm never opposed to constructive criticism if it means I grow from the experience (unless that constructive criticism involves where I put my curly braces).</p>

<h2>Languages I use</h2>

<p>(In order of strength)</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS</li>
<li>Python 2&amp;3</li>
<li>C# and the .NET framework</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>ActionScript 2 &amp; 3 (Went through a HUGE Flash game dev phase)</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>VBA (ew)</li>
<li>PowerShell</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other things with which I'm pretty familiar</h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML 4/5</li>
<li>CSS 3</li>
<li>XML</li>
<li>JSON</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Programming

<ul>
<li>Developing utilities and games for fun.</li>
<li>Maintaining my personal website.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Video Games

<ul>
<li>Any Japanese RPGs (my current fav is Square Enix's Bravely Default (I'm a huge sucker for a job system))</li>
<li>ALL THE POKEMON (recently completed my national Pokedex. Take that Markus Smithson from 2nd grade. Who's the master now!!!??!... Did I mention the miracle of me being married?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Music

<ul>
<li>Guitar</li>
<li>Singing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Art

<ul>
<li>Digital painting/sketching</li>
<li>Web design</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Art Stuffs</h2>

<p>I used to do quite a bit of Digital Illustration and even some 2D animation for a while there, but not so much any more. When I <em>was</em> doing that stuff though, I was using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Flash CS5</li>
<li>Photoshop CS5</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator CS5</li>
<li>Procreate (iOS application that runs MIND-BLOWINGLY well on a first gen iPad)</li>

Later in the 70's I started making small programs using punch-tape and cards. Terminals were hard to get your hands on. In the early 80's I bought one of the first Commodore Vic 20. Then reading the Byte magazine, a couple of friends started expanding our Vics, and interfacing tapedecs (big reel ones) and daicy-wheel typewriters - the matrixprinters wasn't all that readable (9 pins)
Then I got my first PC (8086) soon followed by an AT (80286) and more.
I was working on IBM AIX mainframes and HP Visualizer Workstations great machines.
Then sadly they were replaced by Windows servers, and I was looking for a replacement for my own use. I tried some different Linux flavors, and somehow settled on Ubuntu some years ago, it was great until suddenly my NetBeans generated errors all over, for no apperant reason - turned out Ubuntu update removed my Sun-Java without telling. Then came Unity and I am incompatible with all those BIGG mostly useless icons, that was fixed, but next upgrade undid all the work. To the rescue SUSE then Studio 64 This Ubuntu flavor I really adore!</p>

<p>I like Go, as a statically typed C-style-OOP systems programming language, but it doesn't have generics, and doesn't encourage functional practices.

<h3>Userscripts</h3>

<p>I've made some userscripts for the Stack Exchange sites you may be interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>My SOOF userscript, now <a href=""http://stackapps.com/questions/6091"">Stack Overflow Extras</a>, has a bunch of optional features you can add to 'enhance' SE (examples of these features are: pre-defined edit reasons; keyboard shortcuts for pre-defined comments; highlight answerer's names in comments, and so on)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6571/26088"">SE WYSIWYG Editor</a> userscript adds a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor to Stack Exchange - definitely worth a try! :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6353/26088"">Freehand Circles Drawing Tool</a> userscript allows you to draw directly onto images you see on SE sites - you can change the brush colour and width to draw <em>anything</em> you might want - it's great fun, useful and easy to use :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6316/26088"">Self Destructing Comments</a> userscript allows you to set a date at which a comment you wrote should be deleted - useful for those 'comment cleanup', 'thanks', or 'welcome' comments.</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6460/26088"">SE Desktop Notifications</a> userscript shows desktop notifications whenever there is new activity on a question open in a new tab - useful for keeping track of questions without having to scroll through the answers to see if there is a new edit, or comment, or score change :)</li>
<li>See <em>many</em> more at my <a href=""http://stackapps.com/users/26088/"">Stack Apps profile</a> :)</li>

I enjoy programming in Ruby, J, C, and JavaScript, in addition to my own languages like <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/stacked"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stacked</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/attache"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Attache</a>. When I'm up for the challenge (or feel like hurting my mind), I pick up <a href=""https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brainf***</a>.</p>

<p>Code golf is an interesting way to program recreationally. I personally enjoy code golf because it's basically one large test case for a language I make. After all, I believe a language is only as good as it can be short. (Thus Java often falls out of favor with me...)</p>

<p>Similarly, I heavily enjoy obfuscation. It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language, and an art form in itself.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love, TF2 is life), writing, reading, or (<em>gasp</em>) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.</p>

<p>About <em>me</em>, I'm a Christian teenager, proud to be serving my God. I do what I can to let people know there is a God who loves them, without stepping on people's toes. I'm not shy about my faith, though I try not to flaunt it or greet people with a ""HeyhowareyoudoyouknowJesus???/??"", e.g.</p>

So doing something manually isn't always quicker, and it's certainly less fun ;) Plus you learn more that way. In any case, save your work and notes, archive it in such a way that you can find it again :P</p>

<p><em>But he said to me, ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</em></p>

Written in BASIC, z80a, 6502, 68000, x86, PASCAL, Forth, C, C++, Perl, Javascript and C#. Written for ASICs through to Windows apps so have been around the block a bit. Mainly written for Educational publishing in recent years, getting heavily into ASP.NET at the moment and looking at MVC for my next apps.

<p>Most of my work these days is with embedded systems, primarily AMD Geode with the occasional Via processor or ATmega.  I've started looking at ARM and PIC parts as well.  Communications is mostly RS485 or PLC, and protocols are Modbus (RTU and TCP) or proprietary.</p>

<p>I've also been doing a fair bit of circuit design and PCB layout of late, which I actually started doing long before I ever wrote a lick of software.  Apparently I'm regressing.  I'm back to thinking that 2KB RAM is ""a lot"".  I expect to be playing with Legos and milk carton building blocks in another 10 or 15 years.</p>

<p>Active member of the <a href=""http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers"">SOCVR</a> (despite lacking the CV-privilege). Feel free to join us &amp; help keeping SO clean!</p>

<p>I love discussions of all sorts, and I actively participate in them whenever I feel like it (wether it's on meta or in chat).</p>

<p><strong>What I enjoy:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>discussions</li>
<li>analysing anything</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>designing projects</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I absolutely dislike:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working with a poorly designed project</li>
<li>ignorance</li>
<li>""Separators"" (properties used to separate people into different categories)

<ul>
<li>Popular examples are ethnicity, skin color, gender</li>
</ul></li>
<li>""offended"" people

<ul>
<li>If someone disagrees with your opinion, <em>deal with it</em></li>
<li>If someone does something you dislike, <em>deal with it</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Please understand that whatever one does, it's that persons business, as long as it is not actually affecting other people, and even then it's just bound by laws. If I were to tell a person off for believing in the spaghetti monster because it offends me, how'd that make me look like? Exactly the same way as most ""offended"" people: <strong><em>Stupid.</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:</p>

<h2>SI units</h2>

<p>To avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SI brochure</a>, but there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit, for example: 12&#8239;V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-breaking space</a>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol, <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>12 V (normal space)</li>
<li>12&nbsp;V (&amp;nbsp;)</li>
<li>12&#8239;V (&amp;#8239;)</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>""I'm in Europe.""</em></h2>

<p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em>, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>

<p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this legal?</li>
<li>Where can I buy things?</li>
</ul>

I soon got interested in Java, which is now one of my favorites. I've also attempted to learn C++ (which I find needlessly difficult), and a little Python.<br>
More recently I've started trying to learn Ruby on Rails and would like to one day learn PHP. My current project is an <a href=""https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x"" rel=""nofollow"">algebra solver</a>, having found that most free solvers either do not show their work, or work hard to confuse the user with their steps.<br>
I'm interested in native desktop GUI programming, and for that reason have been looking for a high-level (i.e. OOP, garbage collector, etc.) programming language that compiles to machine code and (preferably) has libraries for native GUIs. The possibilities so far are D and Haxe, using Qt in both cases. I am interested to hear of others.</p>

<p>S: Linux kernel build fails with mmap error on VirtualBox shared folder</p>

<p>Q: When building the Linux kernel on a VirtualBox shared folder, I get almost all the way through the build, but then it fails during ""SORTEX vmlinux"" and reports ""Could not mmap file: vmlinux"".  This is consistent with problems that others have reported with mmap on VirtualBox shared folders.</p>

<p>A: As a fix for this very specific case, I modified kernel/scripts/link-vmlinux.sh function sortextable() from this:</p>

<pre><code>$(objtree)/scripts/sortextable ${1}
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>cp ${1} /tmp/.${1}

<p>I have earned some experience in <a href=""/questions/tagged/wpf"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;wpf&#39;"" rel=""tag"">wpf</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/mvvm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mvvm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mvvm</a>. I realy love how the <a href=""/questions/tagged/databinding"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;databinding&#39;"" rel=""tag"">databinding</a> works. Sadly today everything needs to be mobilefirst. It's rare to have the opportunity to do a project based on this.</p>

<p>In current days I am fallen in love with <a href=""/questions/tagged/c%23"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;c#&#39;"" rel=""tag"">c#</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;asp.net-mvc&#39;"" rel=""tag"">asp.net-mvc</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/entity-framework"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;entity-framework&#39;"" rel=""tag"">entity-framework</a> , <a href=""/questions/tagged/webapi"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;webapi&#39;"" rel=""tag"">webapi</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/twitter-bootstrap"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;twitter-bootstrap&#39;"" rel=""tag"">twitter-bootstrap</a>. I am excited about every new technology I am able to meet.</p>

<p>Next things I want to learn about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/uwp"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;uwp&#39;"" rel=""tag"">uwp</a></li>
<li><a href=""/questions/tagged/mvc-core"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mvc-core&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mvc-core</a> (Hell yeah: taghelpers looking so promising!)</li>
<li>Gemedevelopment in general</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to provoke me, simple write Yoda-Code:</p>

<p>With over thirty years of programming experience, I think I've finally earned the title ""veteran"" (got the scars to prove it, too). I've also done sysadmin and support work, getting my hands and knees dirty pulling a plethora (and yes, I do mean ""abundance"") of cabling through ducts that greased spaghetti would have had trouble passing through. Beating reluctant UNIX and Novell servers with a one pound mallet until they agreed to work in rooms radiating a pleasant 38 degrees Celsius. With soothing, well modulated words calming down workers close to suicide who had unwittingly rebooted their machines before saving their gargantuan spreadsheets. During these perspiring years I often put together small tools and apps to help make my admin life easier. And in the early years of my computerized life (during high school) I programmed for fun in languages and on machines that have now been more or less forgotten. All those years I've dreamt of designing and creating the ""PERFECT OPERATING SYSTEM""! But that is another story…</p>

I'm also good in creating websites in fully W3C-compliant code (I don't like WYSIWYGs, nor do I like non-standard languages and most non-common methodologies).

<p>Please note: If I post a comment on a question or an answer, I have no objection <strong>at all</strong> if anyone ""steals"" ideas from the comment and uses them to write a <strong>good</strong> answer.

I don't even mind if you take an idea from my comment and type up an answer based on it faster than I can.   Ideas can not be stolen, they're not property to begin with.

I have been programming for 10 years, lived on a ranch all my life, and have been a Wilderness Guide for 4 years. I am very interested in learning to be a better programmer (both in knowledge and craft).</p>

<p>Instead of By Day/By Night, I will write it in seasons.</p>

<p>By Winter, I ski! I have been a Volunteer High School Nordic Ski Coach for 4 years (And hopefully this upcoming season I will be a paid Assistant Coach).</p>

<p>By Spring, I program! I love Javascript and Python, tho I have experience in some other languages. I currently have a Programming internship at <a href=""https://www.nols.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nols</a> (awesome company, check us out: www.nols.edu)</p>

<p>By Summer, Mountains and Hay! I own my own little Hay Hauling business (bucking hay is a ton of fun! And a great way to get in shape). And I work as a Wilderness Guide for a <a href=""http://www.wyominghiking.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">llama trekking company</a> (also an awesome company, go see them at www.wyominghiking.com)</p>

<p>By Fall, Who Knows? I don't really have any plans for this fall. Which probably means I will get more chances to program!</p>

<p>I feel I can contribute to the SE Language Sites, because I use English, German, and French daily and extensively. I am currently attempting to find some time to learn another latin-based language, most likely Spanish, but Italian is also still in the running. I have picked up comprehension skills in both during my travels, thanks to 5 years of latin in school, and 20+ years of exposure to French.</p>

<p>Now, without further ado, on to me!</p>

<h2>Thom Blair III</h2>

<p>Hi! I'm new to Blender but have been doing computer graphics since I was 13 or so. In fact, I remember when I got the first demo release of Adobe's first graphics program that was to become Photoshop. It came on a 5¼ inch floppy, ie before there even were 3.5 inch floppies, and I just laughed at how basic and lack-luster it was compared to Splash (which was the higher-end graphics software out at the time.) In Splash, they already had begun using brushes with soft edges, which was a HUGE leap forward for graphics software at the time -- no other software I could find had that feature. There also was no such thing as any kind of selection tool other than rectangle, although they might have had ovals. Anyway, I tried Adobe's program and it was so simplistic I thought, ""Wow, Adobe -- what kind of name is that?? Sticks and mud! Kinda appropriate for such a rudimentary program."" Little did I know what was to come! Now I can't even find any trace of Splash on the internet at all! The wheel of Fate turns and turns...</p>

<p>I also remember when I first started hearing about this new kind of graphics format called ""vectors"". The makers of the graphic novel ""Iron Man: Crash"" were some of the first to use vectors in comics, and vector-based software was being developed as they were making the novel. </p>

<p>I had one job for a year overseeing a team of programmers to transition from an outdated PDP mainframe to a Microsoft Access database for a small university's Registrar office. It was very successful there, and so 5 related universities in India wanted it for their registrars, so I took it over there, modified it for them and trained them to use it.</p>

<p>These days, I am just taking my time doing things I enjoy when I can find them and currently, I'm really enjoying adding Blender to my graphics suite -- I'm very impressed with it!</p>

As a matter of course, I know SQL and use it frequently. I have a passing knowledge of ActionScript, javascript, python, AHK (a most under-rated tool, imo), and assorted web languages.</p>

<p>I weave chainmail in my spare time, play piano, dance, and play video games.</p>

<p>In case you want my opinion on some things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle TimesTen is a monster. Holy crap though, it is blazingly fast.</li>
<li>Guice is a beast which should only be used when you never want people to know where data is coming from. It could be justified by testing, but for the love of all that is holy QUIT MAKING SO MANY MODULES. You need like, 3, for a medium-sized project.</li>
<li>Mockito is amazing &lt;3</li>
<li>MySQL performs like a drunken elephant, but it's free and easy to use. Also, it's workbench is very nice, and I like it.</li>
<li>It is frustrating that most Linux developers act like Linux is the default environment for computers. If Linux is so superior, then why can't it (or at least most of the main utilities for Linux) handle even the most basic crap like a CRLF? Why don't people make many good video games for it? Is it more secure, or do Linux users just tend to actually follow basic security protocols?</li>
<li>If you complain about Java 8+ memory management, you are probably using it wrong.</li>

<p>First of all, to answer your question: yes. My username is derived from the xkcd comic: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/327/</a> . I am not the original Little Bobby Tables. I just thought it would be a good username since he is one of the more iconic characters. My favorite comic(s):
<a href=""http://xkcd.com/1133/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1133/</a>
<a href=""http://xkcd.com/350/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/350/</a> (&lt;-- I'm actually trying to build that)</p>

<p>My hobbies include programming (specifically os and compiler design), brain teasers (such as sudoku) and spending time with my gf. I have been programming for about four years now on a variety of platforms, including windows, linux, and mac. I currently use the gnu gcc toolchain (with flex and bison) on linux mint to develop. I don't like ides, and as a result use the terminal and gedit. My career goal is to get a degree in cs and start working in the field of encryption. If you need to contact me you can reach me here via pm (i dont actually check that email. i just needed it for the account) or on the irc.quakenet.org irc channel #cplusplus. My fastest time solving a rubiks cube is 1:10, which if you can solve one you realize how disgraceful those 10 seconds are. I have been on this forum before under a different username, but I wont reveal it.</p>

<p>“Gratitude is the ability to experience life as a gift. It liberates us from the prison of self-preoccupation.” –John Ortberg</p>

<p>“If you love a flower, don’t pick it up.
Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love.
So if you love a flower, let it be.
Love is not about possession.
Love is about appreciation.” 
―Osho</p>

<p>""Never be ashamed of what you feel. You have the right to feel any emotion that you want, and to do what makes you happy. That's my life motto."" –Demi Lovato</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our identity as a nation – unlike many other nations – is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood. Being an American involves the embrace of high ideals and civic responsibility. [...]</p>
  
  <p>This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.</p>

<h3>How to save <strong>notes to self</strong> (e.g. ToDos) on Stack Exchange</h3>

<p><sub>(A lil' Stack' hack:)</sub></p>

<p>Put this at the beginnning of your public profile <em>About me</em>:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;!--
# notes to self – ! REMEMBER TO RE-HIDE ! #

Don't screw with Jon Skeet!  Not under any circumstance.

    --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's 4 spaces before <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code>.  Before saving, hide this HTML comment section, by removing a space before the <code>&lt;!--</code>.  When you return here, you can have your self-notes section rendered in markdown by re-adding the space before <code>&lt;!--</code>.  (Don't forget to remove it again  when you're done.)  When this HTML comment section is not rendered in markdown, it is also not included in the generated HTML source code, so your notes are perfectly private from other users' eyes.</p>

<p>You can use markdown formatting in there, but no HTML tags.</p>

<p>Caveat: Stack Exchange limits your total About Me code to 3000 chars. :(<br>
If you need more than that, you could swap non-secret stuff into an answer in the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3122/formatting-sandbox/"">http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3122/formatting-sandbox/</a> and put a link to that public notes answer into your hidden profile notes.</p>

All posts are my own opinions, and do not reflect the views of my employer.</p>

<p>I'm available, in a volunteering capacity, to support education events around the Cambridge area, provided these are STEM focused, and involve specific technical activities or relate to 'typical careers and working conditions' in engineering and technology.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about writing a series of blog posts centred around the 'Performing Engineering Operations Level 2' NVQ qualification. There doesn't seem to be much good source material, the teaching (of assessed knowledge) is poor, and the questions asked for assessment have no real answers at all.</p>

<p>I'm also desperate to drag the pre-university teaching of electronics and computing way from 1970's hardware examples. I see students today learning with NE555, and 7805 - these components are as old as me, and are much less likely to be the correct choice. There are questions about pre-forming components - components are, in the main, now designed for automated pick-and-place, not wire-wrap and hand assembly.</p>

<p>After a few years I realized the absurdity of writing webpages in Java, writing logic in XML, and trying to ignore the stateless client/server model. I returned to good ol' regular web dev and began my recovery. I'm now a fully functioning full stack developer happily playing with various technologies and methodologies in a PHP/JS environment.</p>

<pre><code>x2 + y2 = z2
</code></pre>

<p>Euclid gave the complete solution for that equation, but for more complicated equations this becomes extremely difficult. Indeed, in 1970 Yu. V. Matiyasevich showed that Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable, i.e., there is no general method for determining when such equations have a solution in whole numbers. But in special cases one can hope to say something. When the solutions are the points of an abelian variety, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that the size of the group of rational points is related to the behavior of an associated zeta function ζ(s) near the point s=1. In particular this amazing conjecture asserts that if ζ(1) is equal to 0, then there are an infinite number of rational points (solutions), and conversely, if ζ(1) is not equal to 0, then there is only a finite number of such points.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>My favorite field of study is quantum computing. Right now, I'm especially focused on reading about spontaneous parametric down conversion and am working on an experiment related to that. I've written a paper (meant merely for practice; it doesn't contribute anything new) on quantum error correction that can be viewed <a href=""https://github.com/physicsnerd/Bit-Flip-Code---Quantum-Error-Correction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I'm also working on an ideal simulator of a quantum computer in Python; I recently figured out a major problem, so I made some decent progress over the past couple of months (though school has gotten in the way a bit).</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>I've typed up some notes on calculus and other topics in LaTeX (warning: I'm not as consistent in updating my repositories as I should be), which can be viewed on github <a href=""https://github.com/physicsnerd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I'm constantly working on Github projects, including my calculus notes. I also worked through the mechanics section of <em>Conceptual Physics</em> by Hewitt (yay!) and am now working through the later sections. I always enjoy learning new things about Python. I also read a lot of Tolkien and mythology - I'm currently reading through the Kalevala and Tolkien's letters.</p>

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Java security is also a main focus. I also provide secure coding guidance to the development teams as well as various security architect activities.</p>

<p>I have been working as a professional IT employee for over 25 years.</p>

<p>I am a Raspberry Pi enthusiast making(and breaking) small robotics and smart home projects although I won't be making large at this point.</p>

<p>I also am an aspiring author, although my books are a long way off being published at present and it is more of a hobby than a career choice. </p>

My first ever bunch of code that I wrote was in C# using the Unity3d game engine. Ever since then my passion for code has been growing. I've since moved away from Windows with C# to study Linux with a mixture of C and C++. </p>

<p>I believe that if you want to learn how something works you need to understand the underlying structure of what ever it may be. To implement this belief I have conducted my own research in:
Linux administration and maintenance.
OpenGl and FreeGlut GUI programming (in C).
Basic Advanced Linux Sound Architecture(ALSA) programming (in C).
Server and Client socket programming (in C).
Encryption protocols and algorithms (in C).
Programming security concepts such as buffer overflows and race conditions.
Windows, Mac, and Linux security hardening.
Advanced port service configurations such as SSH RSA authentication.
Ethical cyber attacks and defenses.
SSL Apache Web Servers (port 443).
I can remember the 7 OSI layers via an acronym.</p>

<p>This list is always growing and I'm always looking for ways to improve my programming skills. One of the greatest issues that I face is the lack of projects! The stuff that I do have going on in my free time requires a deeper understanding of military encryption algorithms and operating system architecture.</p>

<p>I take every chance that I get within each day to research my task at hand and to work on implementations.</p>

<p>my name is Jonas. I'm working in a medium-sized company doing a lot of programming. And to know about hacking is a valuable asset in my opinion. That's why I am educating myself on it.

<p>Mostly fixing people's computers &amp; flashing their BIOS when their kids have done stupid things. I am better than average with hardware, and recognising symptoms. </p>

<p>I've had cases where I have fought with ISP's who are telling me the equipment I supplied is faulty, only for them to finally admit one of their DSLAM's got hit by lightning: no apologies, nothing, for wasting 3 weeks of my time. </p>

<p>I had another battle with an ISP where they refused to admit they had a faulty DSLAM, resulting in all our traffic going the long way around. I won that one, too.</p>

<p>I am not a genius, but I am interested enough to make sure that what I am doing is the right thing.</p>

<p>I can code, but I spend a lot of time looking for answers. It's not something I actively do, so it's very difficult because it's all changing so quickly &amp; to be a proper coder you need to stay on top of these things. I search as I need, and learn as I must.</p>
